<h2>
CHAPTER I
<br />
THE LITTLE GIRL
</h2>

<p>
It is one of the compensations of Providence that
after the storm and stress of active life is through, one
can go back to the beautiful world of memory and
live over the earlier joys with a delight not experienced
in youth.
</p>

<p>
So the time I first saw the Little Girl is one of the
pictures that line the halls of remembrance, softened,
and it may be rendered more beautiful, by the intervening
years, and love.
</p>

<p>
It was a late September evening, at least the day
had waned. All the west still held the peculiar rich
glow of a magnificent sunset that had melted now
into one great sheet of softened tints, with no one
distinct color predominating, and changing every instant.
Over the great lake it dropped iridescent hues,
and even the river, with its muddy banks, shimmered
in a glorified light. And I, Norman Hayne, sat idly
outside the log end of the house, that was our real
living place, though the frame addition had been
added, for we had long ago outgrown the other. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
was a rude porch over the door, where the Michigan
rose rioted in the early summer, and morning-glories
later on. Beyond this was a bench with a pail, one or
two basins and a dishpan piled with dishes, where my
mother would presently stand, washing up. Various
utensils hung from the edge of a narrow shelf, a gourd
dipper and one of cocoanut. Out beyond, on the
garden fence, was the churn dasher and the churn on a
low pole.
</p>

<p>
Early August had been hot and dry, then had fallen
copious rains and everything had taken a new lease
of life. I was looking idly over to the eastward, wondering
what the "States" were like, though it would
seem from the influx of emigrants and their tales that
they held every variety of climate and productions
known to the world.
</p>

<p>
I watched a great covered wagon lumbering along,
drawn by two not over large but stocky horses.
In a vague fashion I said to myself—"Some one
from the States." It had not the air of a near-by
native.
</p>

<p>
The driver jumped down with a loud "whoa," and
the animals, nothing loth, stood still. We were back
perhaps fifty feet from the road, though it had a name
as a street.
</p>

<p>
Mother came out just as the man walked up the
path. She was rather stout, somewhat weather-beaten
with our fierce winds, but fresh and wholesome looking,
with a kindly smile, that had not been banished
by the scoldings she had found necessary to use. Her
hair was a soft dun-colored brown, her eyes brown
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
also, with a sort of twinkle in them that sometimes
flashed in the heat of anger.
</p>

<p>
The man gave his faded wool hat a tug. He was
of medium height, much seamed and wrinkled by exposure,
with shrewd blue eyes, rather reddish hair and
a sparse ragged beard, the sort of man who would
hardly attract a second look.
</p>

<p>
"Ma'am," he began, in a respectful tone, "can you
tell me just how I shall find the Towner place, and can
I reach it to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Well—" mother looked over westward—"I can't
say I should advise you to attempt it. It's crost the
river. An' ther' ain't much but a tumble-down log
hut. Be you the man goin' to live ther'? Towner
traded off the place an' was in high feather 'bout his
bargain."
</p>

<p>
The man looked rather crestfallen. "I was in hopes
I could. But then it's good to be so near," with a sigh
of content in the voice. "There's some taverns about,
I suppose, though, for that matter, we could take
another night in the wagon."
</p>

<p>
"What fambly is ther'?" and mother peered out
rather curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Only me and my little gal. There's such big
stories told about Chicago."
</p>

<p>
"An' they're comin' out the little end of the horn,"
said mother with a short laugh. "You can hardly
give lots away."
</p>

<p>
The man stood rather uncertain.
</p>

<p>
"See here," began mother, who was hospitality
itself, "we can put you up for the night. S'pose you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
unhitch and take a bite of supper. It's tough goin' to
a strange place in the dark, an' a tavern ain't jest the
place for a little gal. Norme, you great lazy lout,
stir your stumps, and show the way to the barn.
Bring your little gal in here, Mister. I declare for it,
a gal is quite a treat. I've five boys an' I'm countin' on
the time they get married so's I can see a petticoat
around."
</p>

<p>
"Do I come up here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes." I was off with a bound and began to turn
the tired beasts up the roadway. Just at the stoop I
paused.
</p>

<p>
"I'm mighty obliged to you," he began, bowing
to mother. "'Tisn't everybody you find willing to
take in a stranger. But I'm going to stay if I can
squeeze out any sort of a living. Times are hard
everywhere. Seems as though the bottom's fallen out
of everything."
</p>

<p>
"When the bottom falls out 'er Chicago we fill it in
agen," returned mother with a heartsome laugh.
"You've come to a queer place, stranger. First, we're
way out top of the chimbly wavin' defiance to everybody
and braggin' like all possessed, then down we
come kerflunk! But we rub our bruises and knock off
the soot an' go at it agen."
</p>

<p>
"That's the way you have to do," was the almost
cheerful response. Then he went to the side of the
wagon and chirped, and lifted out the Little Girl and
put her down. I looked intently at her and she was
impressed upon my brain.
</p>

<p>
A little girl of seven or eight in a faded blue cotton
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
frock that came two or three inches from her ankles,
and her dainty feet were encased in a pair of beaded
moccasins. Her light hair, more flaxen than golden,
hung about in short loose curls. Her skin was very
fair, her mouth like an opening rosebud. But her eyes
transfixed one even in the growing darkness. They
seemed bathed in dewy sunshine and were of the depth
of sapphire, or the blue of a winter night. The brows
and lashes were much darker than the hair, the eyes
large and clear, but after she had once glanced up
fearlessly they drooped and seemed to shine through
the lashes.
</p>

<p>
"You are just a little dear," said mother, and she
stooped to kiss her, though she was not at all given
to caresses. "And now while they go out to look
after the horses I'll fix some supper. I've just cleared
it away. My, but it's dark as a pocket in here. I'll
light a candle. Have you had a long journey?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, days and days! Sometimes we stayed at houses
and sometimes in the wagon. There were wolves one
night and father shot two, and we stayed one night in
an Indian wigwam. The squaws were kind, but the
babies were so funny, tied to a board and standing
round. I didn't like the food though. I can cook
some."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you any mother?"
</p>

<p>
The child sighed. "Mother died a long, long while
ago. Why do they have to be put in the ground? I
should think they'd be carried up on some high
mountain, where it would be easier for the angels to
get them."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"And who took care of you?"
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Getty did. Then she married Silas Bowers
and he had seven children. I didn't like them though.
Then Gran came out of the poorhouse, and after that
some of the things were sold, only what we could
pack in the wagon. It was very nice at first. We
stopped by the woods and made fires and broiled
fish and birds that father shot. You make a little
stone fireplace so—" and she described the outline
with her hands. "And when the wood gets all
burned to coals you can broil, or you can fry in a
skillet."
</p>

<p>
"You're a smart little thing," declared mother in
amazement. "Why you're not much bigger than a
minute."
</p>

<p>
"Why a minute is sixty seconds, and what do you
suppose the seconds are?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't know," and mother laughed.
</p>

<p>
It looked cheery enough when I came in. It should
have been painted as an "Interior in Old Chicago."
The room was large with a great fireplace at one end,
the logs had been chinked in with plaster and then
plastered over again, quite roughly to be sure. Every
spring and fall mother whitewashed it. Now it was
rather smoky. Dan and I had put up a kind of dresser
on one side, shelves braced up by side brackets and a
curtain hung over them. Our chairs had tough reed
grass bottoms, braided in a fashion learned from the
Indians. There were several gun racks, and some
trophies of hunting. On one side was a roomy settle
that did duty as a bed, with dried grass pillows and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
cured skins, some quite valuable. Mother had two
candles lighted on the table, and they shed a sort of
weird light around. She was warming up some
chicken potpie, and there was a great plate of brown
bread and white, and another of gingerbread and an
appetizing sauce of wild grapes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gaynor had stopped at the bench and washed
face and hands with a great flourish of enjoyment.
Now he sniffed at the savory fragrance with the eagerness
of a hungry man.
</p>

<p>
"Jest draw up," said mother, nodding to a chair.
But she placed one for the Little Girl and would have
lifted her in it, only she slipped by with the litheness of
a fairy.
</p>

<p>
"What is your name, Sissy?"
</p>

<p>
"Ruth—Ruth Gaynor," was the gentle reply.
</p>

<p>
"And I am John Gaynor from old Massachusetts.
I've wondered along the route what evil spirit enticed
me to leave the State where I was born, but somehow
luck turned against me, and the farm was a bed
of rocks, as one may say—worn-out land. There's to
be a great wheat-growing country out here, folks say,
and bread is one of the things that doesn't seem to go
out of fashion. Jerusalem! but there's a sight of folks
growing up all the time. When the world gets full
I s'pose it'll have to come to an end, for if it is full of
folks, stands to reason there won't be no room for
wheat growing."
</p>

<p>
"Laws a' massy, I never thought of that," said
mother. "But ther's wars and plagues an' what not.
Sissy, you ain't eating no supper."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'm eating slow, tastes so good," returned Ruth
gravely, looking up with shining eyes.
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden rush and howl and she started
in terror, turning pale.
</p>

<p>
"It's them dratted boys," explained mother, going
to the door. "Boys—" one or two of them had a resounding
cuff—"you air worse'n a pack of wolves!
Now jes' wash up in some sort o' quiet or you'll get
your father's horsewhip. An' then go straight to bed.
Go round 'tother way."
</p>

<p>
"Who's here?" both in a breath.
</p>

<p>
"That's nothin' to you. Do as I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"There air three of the noisiest boys in all Chicago.
Dan, he's quiet and grouty like when things don't go
to suit, but he's smart. This here boy's slow an' easy
like, an' not given to tantrums, an' I guess we'll have
to make a 'pason' out of him. Then there's Homer
an' Ben 'n Chris, an' they'd tear the house down if they
got at the underpinnin'. Norman here should have
been a gal! My! but I was disappointed when he
come. I'd jes' set my heart on a gal. Then I got
kinder hardened and didn't care. Boys!"
</p>

<p>
She went out again and presently there was a giggling
and a scuffling off. There was an outside covered
stairs leading to the attic over this end of the
house and the boys slept there.
</p>

<p>
I had been watching the Little Girl. I had no word
for it then, but I knew afterward it was daintiness
that enveloped her. She sat up so straight and ate so
quietly, even in drinking her glass of milk she made
no noise. Then she looked up at mother and smiled.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"It was such a good supper," she said, and her eyes
shone with dewy softness. Then she turned a little
and glanced at me, and I felt my cheek burn from
some unwonted cause. Not but what girls had looked
at me before, and I had romped with them.
</p>

<p>
"I'm wonderfully obliged, ma'am," and Mr. Gaynor
rose from the table. "The beasts, too, are thankful no
doubt. Hoping presently you'll be better paid, though
I take it that kindness isn't ever made quite straight
with money, and I'm glad enough to be so near my
journey's end. What sort of a place is Towner's?"
</p>

<p>
Mother looked at me. "You can tell best, Norme,"
she said with a nod.
</p>

<p>
"It's just a little 'tother side of the river. The log
house isn't much. There's quite a garden spot, then it
runs out on the prairie, and up the lake. He cut some
of it up in blocks and sold, but I heard pop say he had
to take it back."
</p>

<p>
"Is it the town proper?"
</p>

<p>
"'Twould be hard to tell what's town and what
isn't," said mother, "though they're talkin' 'bout
organizin' something, an' it's high time there was
some sort of head to things. They've been surveying
and surveying and laying out streets that cut up gardens
and farms. Some people think it'll be a great
place, an' others say it can't be anything but a mud
hole. You see, the river rises in a freshet, and the
wind drives the lake in. It's a mighty good place for
ducks. They can sit on the stoop of Tremont tavern
and shoot them."
</p>

<p>
John Gaynor laughed heartily at that.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mother meanwhile had been putting away the food
and gathering up dishes. Now she said:
</p>

<p>
"Light the lantern, Norman, it's grown so dark.
Then bring out the towels. You see," with a light
laugh, "I have to train my boys to do some gal's work.
I don't see when they have to eat why they shouldn't
help clear it away. They'll make all the better husbands."
</p>

<p>
"Would you mind if I came out and smoked my
pipe?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear no," returned mother cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
The lantern shed a light down on the bench, I
brought out the teakettle and filled the pan, and she began
to wash and put the dishes in another pan to
drain. Mr. Gaynor seated himself on the round of a
tree at a little distance. There was a slight touch on
my elbow.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't I help dry them?" inquired a soft voice.
"If you would find me a towel—"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you dear little housemaid!" cried mother admiringly.
"But you ought to play lady to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I used to do it for Gran. And there's so many
here. Isn't it fun to have a good many dishes! Oh,
please do!" in a coaxing tone.
</p>

<p>
"Get her a fresh towel," said mother, amused. So
Ruth Gaynor and I dried the dishes the first time we
saw each other, and with that began a great friendship.
</p>

<p>
"You'll do for a housekeeper," commented mother.
"What a sweet little thing you are! Why I think I
shall have to buy you of your father."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he couldn't spare me, could you, father?"
</p>

<p>
She ran and slipped on his knee and put her arms
about his neck.
</p>

<p>
"No, little one," he made answer.
</p>

<p>
I sat on the end of the bench looking at them, and
envying him. I wondered how the soft arms would
feel about my neck, the rose-leaf cheek pressed against
mine. I was past fifteen and not over fond of browsing
about and noisy games, though I was well grown
and strong. I liked to read and dream, and I was
fond of hearing the men talk when they did not swear
too much, or call each other fools too often. I did
enjoy their aspirations about Chicago and the boundless
west. Chicago was even then an entrepôt for St.
Louis, and also the Mississippi, from upper Michigan
with its endless stack of furs to Canada, and from
thence to Europe. When all these great reaches were
waving cornfields and wheat fields, and there should
be a port extensive enough to accommodate them all,
a gate through which the treasures of the earth and
rain and sun should pass, and the gold and silver of
the world return!
</p>

<p>
Well, it was a splendid dream to be laughed at
then. But had not voyagers a hundred years before
had dreams akin to it?
</p>

<p>
The Little Girl had fallen fast asleep when her father
carried her in. It was very foolish, but I wished I
could have kissed the soft, slightly parted smiling lips
as mother had.
</p>

<p>
Mother lighted them into the new part, where there
was a small sleeping chamber off the best room which,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
no doubt, would have been called a parlor if Dan and
I had been girls.
</p>

<p>
"What a sweet little thing!" mother said with a
sigh. "Too nice to come to a wild town like this."
</p>

<p>
Dan and father were down to the Tremont playing
cards and talking politics. Andrew Jackson was still
President, a man who had warm partisans and bitter
enemies. Then, too, Chicago was beginning to feel
the birth throes of a city.
</p>

<p>
We were up early the next morning. Dan was employed
in one of the trading companies, father at the
mill, and they were off by six in summer. It was true
that I partly did a girl's work helping mother, being
deft and light-handed for a boy. I ran out to the
stable to see if I had dreamed this wonderful event of
the night before. No, there were the horses, who
greeted me with a cheerful whinny, and there was the
wagon with its patched cover.
</p>

<p>
Ruth Gaynor was as sweet and charming in the
morning as she had been at night. Soon after breakfast
they prepared to leave. My mother would accept
nothing for her hospitality except a promise that Ruth
should come over and visit us. The three younger
ones stared at her with boyish bashfulness, and she
did not seem to be inclined to make friends with them.
I was selfishly glad of it.
</p>

<p>
I was to pilot them over. Everything has changed
so now that it is difficult to find an old landmark.
There had been great changes even in my remembrance.
Gurdon Hubbard had moved his business to
Chicago and erected a brick building on the corner of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
South Water and LaSalle streets, the first in the town.
Then he had built a warehouse on Kinzie Street and
was doing a flourishing commission and forwarding
business with vessels plying between Buffalo and the
upper lakes, the Eagle line. Back of this a little was
the space a block square that Towner had traded for
the Massachusetts farm near a thriving city. Then,
still farther away, was the tract of prairie.
</p>

<p>
The house we found in a poor condition. But as
if Mr. Gaynor's luck was to begin at once, some parties
wished to buy half of this plot and a bargain was
struck. That would leave him the house and a garden.
There was such a little money that trade and barter
was often resorted to, and through a third party he
could have lumber enough to build two new rooms on
the house and repair the other. There was a tolerable
barn and stable.
</p>

<p>
We cleared up the best room. It was astonishing
to see the useful articles and bedding that were stored
in the great wagon. We found some second-hand
furniture, and by night they were fairly comfortable.
It was still pleasant, but we built a roaring fire in the
old fireplace to drive away the dampness.
</p>

<p>
What a day it was to me! How fascinating the
Little Girl was in every movement, in her shrewd sayings,
her wisdom that seemed much too old for her
years, yet she was such a frank, eager child.
</p>

<p>
"Must you go home?" she asked pleadingly. "Your
mother has other boys. Can't some of them help her?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose they could be trained to. They have
always kept together and are so full of play."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"And do you work all the time?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I have been to school. But I am old enough
to go to work regularly and mean to soon." I felt as
if I would like to be a man at once, though I could
give no reason for it.
</p>

<p>
"I hate to have you go." She caught hold of my hand
and swung herself gently to and fro. "I like you
very much."
</p>

<p>
She glanced up out of such clear, shining eyes that
she seemed to fill my whole being with their light.
My mother had a right to me—had any one ever really
wanted me before?
</p>

<p>
"Will you come to-morrow? There is so much
work to do," sighing with a fascinating air.
</p>

<p>
"I will come to-morrow," I was glad to promise.
</p>

<p>
"Let me walk down to the end of the street, and
then I will turn and run back, and instead of saying
good-by say 'to-morrow, to-morrow,' and just watch
for the sunrise."
</p>

<p>
She kept my hand until we reached the corner, then
like a fleet little fawn skimmed over the ground, never
once glancing back, and I had known her only twenty-four
hours.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you were well paid for your day's work,"
said my mother laughingly.

<h2>
CHAPTER II
<br />
GETTING DINNER
</h2>

<p>
"The man certainly was a fool," said my father that
evening as he sat smoking his pipe. He had taken part
in a political quarrel the evening before, and so did not
go down to the Tremont to play cards, but read the
<i>Democrat</i> and made promiscuous comments as he
went along.
</p>

<p>
"What man?" asked mother.
</p>

<p>
"Why that Gaynor! The idea of selling out a good
home in a prosperous State and coming out here! If
I could get out of this mud hole to-morrow I just
would."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no you wouldn't. You have said many a time
that Chicago would lead all the Western cities when
she was fairly on the march."
</p>

<p>
"Well—he will never see any of his money or values
back again!"
</p>

<p>
"He disposed of half his plot to Farlie this morning,"
I interposed.
</p>

<p>
"What!" The tone was sharp enough to take one's
head off.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I repeated my assertion.
</p>

<p>
"And swapped for another mud hole?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he wanted lumber and various materials. The
rest is in notes."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, well Farlie'll shave him. Yankees think
they are very smart and shrewd, but he will find!" and
father nodded vindictively.
</p>

<p>
"I think that an excellent thing. They want a comfortable
home and they must have some one to help
out that child. She ought to go to school. She's too
little to keep house. I must go over and see her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do," I entreated. "It's hard to have her there
alone."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, men as a general thing haven't much sense
about rearing gals."
</p>

<p>
"Norman," began my father rather abruptly, "you
go over to Hubbard's. I heard he wanted some help—a
boy good at figuring. When I was twelve years old
I turned out to work. You've had a pretty good
chance at schooling."
</p>

<p>
My heart beat with a quick throb. Why, if I could
get a situation there I could see the Little Girl every
day!
</p>

<p>
"I'll go the first thing," I replied cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"And you needn't stick out about wages. Boys
nowadays think they are worth a heap of gold, but
they're not. Be content to begin down to the
bottom of the line, and thankful that you have the
chance."
</p>

<p>
I was amused. I think I was a rather meek boy
and not given to exalting myself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The three younger ones went to school, and then it
was from eight to five, seven months of the year, from
nine until four through the winter months. It might
have been hard on the teachers, but no one complained.
</p>

<p>
The next morning when I started out my mother
said, "Go and see if that little Gaynor girl is well, and
how they managed last night."
</p>

<p>
I went to the warehouse first. It looked big and
business-y in those days. Vessels were lading, men
were running to and fro, a few negroes among them.
Even at this early period there were protests against
slavery in all the Northern States, and the Missouri
Compromise was supposed to have settled it. There
were hardly a hundred negroes in the town at that
time, and some were tall, strong fellows. A few
Indians were loitering about, though most had been
sent out on the new reservations. They were still considered
rather treacherous, though no longer to be
feared.
</p>

<p>
I picked my way among the piles of goods to the
sort of counting room. Fortunately I saw a familiar
face, Mr. Abner Harris, who had been one of our
neighbors, and had now gone over on the north side.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he began, looking me over from top to toe,
"what can I do for you? We're short handed this
morning, and if you could take a turn—something of
a scholar, ain't you?"
</p>

<p>
I told him my errand and that my father had sent
me.
</p>

<p>
He nodded in a kind of cheerful way, "Yes, we want
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
an office boy who isn't afraid of work and doesn't take
a nap oftener than every three hours. Can you do
lettering? These things should have started yesterday.
While we have the promise that the world will
be burned up, and not drowned out we can't always
count on the wind nor this deceitful lake, which can
smile at you and then drive you heaven only knows
where! My opinion is that when the old Greek gods
were dispersed Neptune took up his residence at the
bottom of this lake and enjoys the rumpus he kicks
up."
</p>

<p>
"Neptune?" I was not much acquainted with the
Greeks in those days.
</p>

<p>
"There, don't stand talking all day." I had only
uttered one word. "Take that bit of board and copy
this, and let's see whether it will be in Latin or High
Dutch. This little brush, and here's the paint."
</p>

<p>
I copied out the address consigned to a Buffalo firm.
</p>

<p>
"That's fair. You needn't stop to flourish. Now go
on with these boxes and bales, seven of them."
</p>

<p>
It came a little awkward at first, but I saw that I
was making a decided improvement. Mr. Harris
nodded. Then there was something else. But before
noon the boat started off, and as I watched her I half
wished I was aboard of her. I had not been a dozen
miles out of Chicago in my fifteen years.
</p>

<p>
Then I thought of the Little Girl.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to be a likely fellow, Hayne, and you
are not continually asking why the sun rises in the
East. That stands for any foolish boy question. I
half engaged a young fellow yesterday, Sim Chase;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
his father is deacon in the church, but he hasn't put in
any appearance yet. I shouldn't like to go back on his
father. Tell you what I'll do. You come in Sat'day
and I'll know then."
</p>

<p>
"I should like very much to have the place," I ventured;
standing on one foot, boy fashion.
</p>

<p>
He gave a funny twinkle with one eye and said,
"Oh, I guess it'll be all right."
</p>

<p>
I went off with a light heart. It was not far to the
Gaynors'. A load of lumber had come and two men
were laying a foundation driving piles. Mr. Gaynor
was giving orders here and there. Few things escaped
his sharp eye. But he only said to me with a curt
sort of nod, "Go round there and see if you can't help
Ruth."
</p>

<p>
I was only too glad. She was trying to make the
fire burn, and the smoke had filled her eyes with tears.
The wood was rather damp and dozy. I looked
around for some dry brush; we were not a well-wooded
country, and presently I had a cheerful blaze.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to have for dinner?" I asked.
"Or have you had it?"
</p>

<p>
"No; father brought in some potatoes and some
fish. I can't bear to touch raw fish," and she shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any sort of a kettle?"
</p>

<p>
"Only this," and she exhumed a long-handled stewing
pipkin, that the folks farther south called
piggins.
</p>

<p>
"That will do for potatoes if we can find a cover."
</p>

<p>
"And this frying pan."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"For the fish. We'll have a fine dinner."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad you came. I wonder what I ought to
call you?" with a kind of delicate perplexity in her
face.
</p>

<p>
"Why! Norman if you like. Mother and pop
shorten it into Norme."
</p>

<p>
"Did you come from—England—Normandy?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I laughed. "Pop, I believe, came from York
State, and mother's folks from down farther south.
You know Chicago isn't a very old place."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to hear about it. It seems very queer.
And you know we have Plymouth Rock. There were
English Governors too, and it is more than two hundred
years old."
</p>

<p>
There was a certain pride in her as she stood there
in her faded gown, her tangled curls about her small
face, her eyes shining with strength through their
lucent light. I could have knelt and kissed her hand.
</p>

<p>
"And they had to cook dinners two hundred years
ago. I suppose they brought over pots and pans in
the Mayflower, and salt and pepper. I couldn't find
any salt this morning," she laughed merrily, "and I've
come in a wagon from Massachusetts. I am an emigrant,
am I not? But I almost wish I had not come."
</p>

<p>
Her voice sank to a pathetic cadence that pierced my
heart.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, don't wish that!" I cried earnestly. "And
there are some curious stories about Chicago—sad
ones, too. We will go to old Fort Dearborn. And for
a good many years one man lived here all alone, and
LaSalle and Joliet and travellers went to and fro and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
left romances in their steps. We will hunt them up
some day. But I must clean the fish. Oh, what nice
plump fellows!"
</p>

<p>
"How good you are. I shall like to see those places.
I like stories." Her face was aglow with interest.
The potatoes were boiling splendidly. I poked in some
rough pieces of wood to make another bed of coals,
then I addressed myself to the fish and soon had
them in frying order. But certainly I must have some
salted pork.
</p>

<p>
I ran down the street a short distance and begged
some from a neighbor. Then I drew out the coals and
we soon had a savory fragrance.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how delicious!" Her eyes fairly shone with
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gaynor came in, his face piquantly wrinkled
with expectation.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to hire you for cook, my lad," he exclaimed
in a joyous tone. "I'm hungry as a bear in
March."
</p>

<p>
"Why March particularly?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"When he wakes out of his winter's nap."
</p>

<p>
"And he doesn't need any table," said the Little
Girl glancing about in a lugubrious fashion, with the
corners of her mouth quivering.
</p>

<p>
"I'll fix that. You two deserve a table for such a
feast."
</p>

<p>
He brought in a board and laid it on two boxes; but
he decided that we must sit on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"And we have sat under a tree on the grass many
a time, haven't we, father?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was such a sound of joyous comfort in her
tone it warmed one's heart.
</p>

<p>
What a feast it was! The fish were browned to a
turn, the potatoes we seasoned with the gravy, and
there was bread and butter. I can recall a little girl
in after life who sat on my knee and never wearied of
hearing about this feast.
</p>

<p>
"Does fall set in early here?" Mr. Gaynor asked.
"I want to get the other room done—it will be two,
really, for this is nothing but a shack. That Towner
must have viewed it with the eye of faith, which is the
evidence of things unseen, and they say the winds are
something terrible."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you'll get them here off the lake, but not so
bad as further down."
</p>

<p>
"What a tremendous lake! It fairly takes one's
breath away. And those prairies! Are they good for
wheat? A new country ought to be. The corn I see
looks fine. Why, it fairly stirs one's blood."
</p>

<p>
Now and then the Little Girl glanced up with a
happy half smile and a light coming and going in her
eyes. How she seemed to enjoy it all.
</p>

<p>
"We're mightily obliged to you, young fellow," Mr.
Gaynor said as he rose. "That was a good dinner.
But Ruth is too little to shoulder this rough sort of life.
I thought I'd see if your mother couldn't find us a
woman to come in part of the time, and we want some
furniture—table and chairs, and some sort of a cot to
sleep on. By the great Mogul! this <i>is</i> coming to a
new country! and it's beginning from the very foundation."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Mother spoke of coming over," I said. "I think
she can find some one. And next week I hope to go
to work at Mr. Hubbard's; then I shall see you often.
Oh, I know my mother is very much interested in you."
</p>

<p>
"And we need a good woman friend, don't we, Little
Girl?" as he softly pinched his daughter's cheek. "We
can imagine how it was when they came over in the
Mayflower. We've come to a new country."
</p>

<p>
Then he went out to look after his men. We tidied
up a little, washed the few dishes and had a merry
time, and to my surprise I saw the portly form of my
mother peering about as if not quite sure of her bearings.
I ran out to her.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," and she kissed the Little Girl. "You
have had some dinner I know by the smell, and I
have brought you a loaf of bread an' a cake an' part of
a boiled ham an' a jar of fruit. It's the grandmother
bringing something to little Red Riding Hood, only
you are not very red. You must get some color in
your cheeks."
</p>

<p>
After we had talked awhile I called in Mr. Gaynor,
who laid a few of his plans and his wants before her,
and she spoke of some help she thought she could get.
</p>

<p>
Then she asked to look over Ruth's clothing.
There was not much of it, and tied up in a pillow case.
Mother gave a few sage nods over it.
</p>

<p>
"She'll want a couple of woollen winter frocks. I'll
conjure them out for her, though I'm quick to say I
know more about jackets and breeches. They can
wait awhile, but she ought to have a new gingham.
You go to church?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Well—I'd like her to go if 'twas handy."
</p>

<p>
"You'll want some dishes an' things, and pervisions.
But you can't bake nothin' 'cept johnny cake. You'll
get a stove? They're mighty handy when you don't
have an oven. Though ther's a bake pan that
answers."
</p>

<p>
"When we get in the new room we'll be a little
more forehanded as to things. Well, do what's about
right," and he gave her some money.
</p>

<p>
The Little Girl looked with wide open shining eyes
as we went along Kinzie Street and turned into LaSalle,
where the Cayses kept a country store at that
time. There were two or three higher toned ones,
where articles were not so promiscuously mixed. At
first glance it seemed like moving day. It was long
and low, with two counters, one for dry goods and a
yard measure, and the other with scales for weighing
everything from powder and shot to an ounce of spice,
coffee, sugar, honey, molasses, butter, pork, hams,
even game that had been traded off for other wants,
along with more bulky wares and farming implements.
</p>

<p>
Ma'am Cayse, as she was generally called, was a
short, stout, strong-looking woman with a square jaw,
large white teeth, a rather flat nose and a forehead that
took full one-half of her face. Her sandy hair was
twisted in a tight knot at the back of her head, her
skirt was short, showing both homespun stockings
and home-made shoes. A sort of loose sacque enveloped
the upper part of her body with the sleeves
rolled over in a wad nearly to the shoulder.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Who's gal is that?" she asked abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Her father took the Towner place. He's buildin'
onto it."
</p>

<p>
"Some one must have money in sech times as these.
It's skace as hen's teeth. I declare to man if I could
get holt of half a dollar I'd pinch the eagle 'til he
squealed, an' ther's goin' to be a vandue, too."
</p>

<p>
"Whose vanduin'?" asked mother with a look of
interest. People in newly settled places are apt to coin
words, I have noticed, and after awhile some of them
get regularly accepted.
</p>

<p>
"Why the Simses, goin' back to Cahoky before cold
weather, but I'd go way down to Noo Orleens if I was
them and wanted to keep warm. An' 'tother folks go
to Canady or up to Mackinac. Ye jest can't count for
tastes. What'll ye have?"
</p>

<p>
Mother ordered with an air of slow indifference.
The gingham was really pretty I thought, with some
fine lines of blue and red with the black and little
squares of white. Some eatables followed in turn, and
the ordinary country gossip until the next customer
came in. It was rather early for the men to be congregating
in a line across the front, smoking their
pipes. Those who tarried here were mostly church-going
people who would not be seen at the taverns,
but dearly loved to argue politics or religion.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad she spoke of that vandue," said mother
when we were out of hearing. "Ther' may be a chance
to get a bargain."
</p>

<p>
For bargains were as dear to women's hearts then
as now.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We rambled down the river side, then crossed the
bridge and came up to recross it again. Mr. Gaynor
had impressed some new workmen in his service and
matters were being pushed ahead rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"And while mother goes to the vandue we will take
a walk," I said. "We'll go to Fort Dearborn, and I'll
tell you the story. Only it is very sad."
</p>

<p>
"The Indian stories always are," she said with a
sigh. "Do you suppose God made them cruel like because
they had to fight each other so much? And
what is there clear out west when they get there?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head. We had not much faith in the
noble red men in those days, and those lingering about
Chicago were rather disreputable.
</p>

<p>
Mother settled with Mr. Gaynor about going to the
Simses' sale, and I arranged to take Ruth to Fort
Dearborn. I would have only two days more.
</p>

<p>
Father was confident the mantle of honor would
fall upon me. Sim Chase he declared a lazy lout.
They had tried him at the mill.
</p>

<p>
The weather was still superb. Ruth and I crossed
the bridge and picked our way over the dusty roads.
Surely we needed rain—we were always either dust or
mud.
</p>

<p>
No one remarked the Little Girl in her faded frock
and sun-bonnet, now nearly white. Now and then
someone looked sharply at me, and it brought the color
to my cheek. I had never thought about girls. I had
gone to a boys' school and had been pretty busy with
lessons and rather fond of staying home with mother
and hearing her talk of her young days. I had no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
especial consciousness about a girl now, my only wish
being that she was truly my sister and lived with us.
</p>

<p>
It is all swept away but the tablet and the monument.
But before the last century had ended, by the
treaty of Granville with five Indian tribes, a piece of
ground six miles square at the entrance of the Chicago
river was set aside for the building of a fort where
there had once been a French trading post. It was a
stockade with block houses, to be one of the chain for
outposts of defence for the trade growing of more importance
every year. Down here came Captain Whistler
and his son and the two wives from Detroit, with
the company for work and for defence, and bravely
they went at their task. On the north side was the
sally port or passage leading from the parade ground
to the river, to be used as an escape in time of emergency.
There were no horses or oxen and the men
hauled the wood. There were Indian outbreaks now
and then, but the little colony increased and all about
the fort clustered a settlement.
</p>

<p>
And so it remained for about nine years. The
women had learned to be as brave as the men, as
fearless too. Then came the sudden and unexpected
orders from Detroit to evacuate the fort, as Detroit
was to be surrendered to the English. There had been
numerous Indian raids on other forts.
</p>

<p>
The Pottawattamies had been very good friends
with the soldiers and the dwellers about. But when
they heard that General Hull had ordered that the
property in the fort was to be distributed among the
Indians they secretly joined the marauding bands,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
though they promised a safe-conduct to those within.
Captain Wells ordered the whiskey to be poured into
the river, and the powder to be destroyed, knowing the
liquor would make fiends of the savages. So one
August day they started, women, children and wagons,
guarded by the soldiers; but when they had gone a
mile or so from the fort, they found themselves almost
surrounded by Indians, the remnants of various tribes
that had not moved to the reservation, and the Pottawattamies
joining them, the dreadful massacre occurred.
A number were carried prisoners to St.
Joseph.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Heald, who had brought with her from Kentucky,
on her marriage, a beautiful mare, which had
aroused the envy of two Indian chiefs, who had made
several attempts to steal it, rode out of the fort, but as
soon as the raid was made she was forced to dismount
and see her favorite in the hands of the savages, and
she was led back to the fort a prisoner, while her husband
was killed and treated with cruel indignity.
Then the Indians took possession of the fort and held
pandemonium for a few days. Afterward the Indians
went off to attack Fort Wayne.
</p>

<p>
We rambled about the fort that had been rebuilt
later on, and was now being evacuated for the second
time, the victories over the rambling bands of Indians
having made the country quite secure. Ruth Gaynor
had heard of massacres in her native State not less
cruel.
</p>

<p>
"But Mrs. Heald and her beautiful horse?" she
queried with pathos in both eyes and voice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No money could buy it back. Some Indian chief
thought too highly of his four-footed prisoner to give
it up. Mrs. Heald, badly wounded, for she had
fought bravely for her freedom, was left for a few
days with an Indian trader at St. Joseph's and was
finally permitted to return to Louisville. Some of the
prisoners were taken up to Michigan and given their
liberty on the recapture of Detroit. The fort was set
on fire and made a heap of ruins. Several of the prisoners
returned, but for a long while the station was
well-nigh deserted by immigrants."
</p>

<p>
It looked deserted now. A drooping flag waved
over it, but there was no glitter of arms or soldiery
tread of sentinels. Business was taking the place of
picturesque romance.
</p>

<p>
"You know," Ruth said in an awed voice, "there are
stories of ghosts appearing. Did no one ever see Mrs.
Heald on her beautiful horse riding out, or around?"
</p>

<p>
It was growing toward night now, and the drifting
clouds had obscured the sunset. The lake stretched
off weird and dark. We had climbed some steps and
now we looked and listened and then glanced at each
other. The spirited form of the woman who had
fought for her life should have appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Come, we must go home," I said. I was conscious
of a curious impression stealing over me.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see <i>her</i>," Ruth said longingly. "I
do not think I should be a bit afraid."
</p>

<p>
I took her hand and helped her down. "We will
come again," I said, "but mother will wonder what has
become of us."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER III
<br />
THROUGH THE WINTER
</h2>

<p>
The workmen were just leaving off when we reached
the place that was to be home for the Little Girl, and
where she was to spend many happy days. To-morrow
they were to raise the framework. There was
no eight-hour day or discussion at that period. I
gathered an armful of blocks and made the fire. We
broiled slices of ham and had some excellent bread, in
the making of which my mother excelled. Mr. Gaynor
was much interested in Fort Dearborn, and
strong in his denunciation of General Hull delivering
up Detroit, as it had inspired the Indians with hopes
of re-conquest of many of the posts. But heroic
Anthony Wayne had soon turned the tide.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were going to stay all night," exclaimed
my mother rather tartly, "or that ther' had
been a new Indian raid and you had lost your headpiece.
Ther' ain't much sense in it, 'pears like, but
you'd look rather queer without it."
</p>

<p>
I only laughed a little. It was the best way of restoring
her to good humor. The men were nearly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
always off playing cards. Dan was nineteen, a fine
strapping fellow, good looking too, and a great hand
for argument. A little one between Dan and myself
had died.
</p>

<p>
Mother went to the vendue and bought some necessary
furnishings for the new house. Meanwhile the
frame had been raised, the near neighbors turning out
to help. Mr. Gaynor's being a Yankee went rather
against him, but the fact that he had some cash to pay
out evened up matters. He treated generously to
whiskey—they were steady drinkers in those days—and
could stand a good deal. He was very abstemious
I learned afterward.
</p>

<p>
Mother also found an old colored woman, half a
century seemed to age the negroes then, and Aunt
Becky had grandchildren grown up. She was quite a
famous cook, and at the rush times at the taverns, holidays
and political gatherings cooked for the feasts.
Any of them would have employed her all the time, but
working steady was her aversion. She was persuaded,
however, to go for two or three hours a day, until
better, or steadier, help could be obtained.
</p>

<p>
I dropped in at the warehouse and found to my
great joy that I had secured the position.
</p>

<p>
"Now you've only got to carry yourself straight and
keep a civil tongue in your head," said my father, "and
you'll get a good business insight that'll make your
fortune some day, if you have brains enough; and
you keep out of taverns and cards and let whiskey
alone until you get ballast enough not to run aground."
</p>

<p>
There was, I suppose, a good deal of dissipation in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
those days, but men were strong and hardy too.
Quarrels were not infrequent and occasionally had a
desperate ending. But there were some admirable
homes, and mothers who left a strong moral impress
on their families. The living had a certain fine simplicity
if it was not so intellectual.
</p>

<p>
I liked my new place very much. I was general
factotum, to be sure, with occasionally an over-measure
of hard words. Mr. Harris always stood my
friend. He soon found that I was ready at figures and
had what he called ideas; my mother's homely name
for it was "gumption." Mr. Gaynor used the word
also.
</p>

<p>
Did any one then, with all the boasting and bragging,
imagine that in half a century Chicago would
spring into wonderful prominence, outstripping older
towns with a vivid maturity, be burned to ashes, rise
again and lift itself not only out of ashes but out of
the slough, and if it could not be a city set on a hill,
still become marvellous in its advancement of all
kinds? I thought then that Eagle fleet of vessels was
simply astonishing with the freights they carried
across the lake. Men were fighting then for a canal, a
clear waterway to the Mississippi without any portage.
</p>

<p>
I liked to hear Mr. Harris's reminiscences of the
town. LeVasseur &amp; Hubbard opened the first dry-goods
store about 1820. Mr. LeVasseur was a fine
man and did a good deal of trading with the Indians
for furs, and had several outlying posts. Mr. Hubbard
was a very public-spirited and ambitious citizen.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
Then for years he coasted up and down the lake in
Canadian bateaux, commonly known as Mackinaw
boats. Some years before this he had erected a large
brick building on LaSalle Street, often termed Hubbard's
folly, where beef and pork were packed for the
outlying trade. His faith in the town was undaunted
by the numerous mishaps, and he was Commissioner
of the Illinois and Michigan canal, and turned the first
shovel of dirt on the nation's birthday, July fourth,
though it languished for several years.
</p>

<p>
I went early and often stayed late, but ran away at
noon to see how it fared with the Little Girl, though I
found my mother was taking a useful oversight of
her. The house went along as if by magic. I can
recall our reading a few fairy stories later on about
palaces springing up in a night, and she laughingly
said—"That was the way with our old house, do you
remember?"
</p>

<p>
The main room had a wide fireplace, the smaller one
beside it was for Ruth, and here stood her cot and a
rude dressing-table and bureau, which was simply a
large box shelved, with a curtain drawn before it.
Then the old log house was patched up and made into
a comfortable kitchen. There was plenty of scrubby
pine for firewood when one could get nothing better.
Mother's vendue furniture comprised a large table,
with leaves supported with a brace and let down when
not in use, a cot, a bedstead set up in the best room,
quite a fashion then, several chair frames that could
be new seated and various kitchen utensils with some
dishes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gaynor was a "handy" man, an ingenious
Yankee. In a couple of months he was in great demand,
and his odd jobs supplied the family living,
for money being a scarce commodity, barter was much
in favor. He was very shrewd at bargain making, but
he had a pleasant, half-whimsical way with him that
made and kept friends.
</p>

<p>
There were several schools now, though it did not
need a very old resident to remember the first one
opened at the end of Mr. Kinzie's garden, where the
children spelled in concert out of the book found in a
tea chest, and learned arithmetic orally. Then Mr.
Watkins taught boys in a room off the postoffice, or
rather the building used for that and sundry other
purposes.
</p>

<p>
A Miss Chappel with her friend, Mary Barrows,
came from Mackinaw and opened a school for girls
and young children. Afterward Miss Chappel married
the Presbyterian minister, Reverend Mr. Porter,
but she still took a warm interest in education. Miss
Barrows went on with the school.
</p>

<p>
We were Methodists, though for some years every
denomination had been represented. A veteran
Methodist preacher, Rev. Jesse Walker, had succeeded
in building a small frame church at Clark and North
Water streets. The women were the most regular
church goers. The children were fond of the Sunday
School, for a large part of the exercises consisted in
singing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gaynor was pleased to have Ruth go. Big
boys were apt to stray off, but I was very regular now,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
and often walked home with the Little Girl, and on
these occasions we had fine fun cooking supper. Then
we would sit before the fire and talk or read. Books
were not very abundant. Mr. Gaynor had an old
Bible, the "Pilgrim's Progress," a copy of "The Lady
of the Lake," and a few old school books. The "Pilgrim's
Progress" we found very entertaining. To us
it was real travels, and the characters absolute people.
</p>

<p>
Ruth came over to the house often on Saturday, as
Miss Barrows kept that day for herself. She learned
to cook, to sew and began to spin a little. She knew
how to knit, except that she did not quite understand
shaping a stocking.
</p>

<p>
The boys were rather rough and shy at first, but
after a little they quite adored her, and hunted up
curious things for presents. Homer was a jolly sort
of lad, Ben rather gentle, but Chris rough and tormenting.
I used to envy them the Saturdays.
</p>

<p>
Winter set in early. What tremendous winds scurried
across the lake, beating up great waves, or rushed
down from the north and sometimes threatened to
drown us out! Navigation had to be given up mostly;
we had not then learned what fetters and warders to
put on the inland sea.
</p>

<p>
And then the snow! The great drifts blowing in
from the prairies, the roads trodden down as solid as
stone, the sledges and rude sort of sleighs, the jingle
of bells for those who were lucky enough to own any.
Part of the time the Little Girl could not venture out,
though Ben often brought her home on his sled.
</p>

<p>
"But it is all so beautiful," she said, looking over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
the wide prairie one Sunday. "Norman, what is over
beyond the Mississippi?"
</p>

<p>
"Mountains and mountains."
</p>

<p>
Some hardy explorers had gone out, but we knew
nothing of the western coast then.
</p>

<p>
"And then?" with gentle insistence.
</p>

<p>
"The Pacific Coast."
</p>

<p>
"The Delectable Mountains and the beautiful land
where the shepherds are feeding their flocks, and
where there are vineyards and gardens and flowers of
every hue and fragrance. It is the Promised Land,
Norman. Some day you and I will start and travel—it
will take weeks and weeks, and we shall be
filled with delight at its loveliness. We will start
quite by ourselves, and keep our secret until we do
go."
</p>

<p>
She looked gravely inspired as her eyes turned
westward over the wastes of snow.
</p>

<p>
Years afterward we were to go to the beautiful
land and wander among orange groves and vines and
figs and such flowers as we had not dreamed of then,
but the name of the country was California.
</p>

<p>
I put my arm over her shoulder. How fair she was,
and her sapphire eyes shone with a kind of unearthly
light. Now and then there came over me a strange
sort of fear as if sometime she might vanish away to
an unknown world and I be left alone.
</p>

<p>
"You are cold," I said; "come in doors."
</p>

<p>
The great log had burned in twain and now broke
with a crash, sending up myriad sparks while the red
coals seemed to pulsate like living things. I stirred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
them up, brought the ends together, and the next
moment we had a magnificent blaze.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let us pop some corn," she cried. She was
down to earth again. "Yes, it does feel lovely here by
the fire. I'll go for the corn."
</p>

<p>
But I thrust down my arm in the great box and
brought up two ears, so that I could shell one with the
other. Mr. Gaynor, with the aid of the blacksmith,
had made a tolerable popper. I drew out the coals
and then shelled a handful. She held it and shook it
from time to time, and we laughed at the snapping
and bouncing. We took off the lid. It wasn't just the
kind of corn to turn inside out, like a white rose, but
some of it was very soft and velvety. I liked the
really roasted grains the best. She, girl-like, preferred
the more delicate ones. So we laughed and ate our
fill until we were thirsty.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she began suddenly, "let us read 'The Lady
of the Lake.'"
</p>

<p>
I did not think I was very fond of verse. It suggested
the hymn book that I looked over now and
then, and that always left an uncomfortable feeling in
my mind.
</p>

<p>
She hunted up the book, and bringing a small stand
near the fire lighted the candle. We had made the blaze
of the pine torch standing up in the corner do duty
until then.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to read," she began. "I liked it so much
one day. But you must sit up very straight and not
go to sleep. This first part about the Harp of the
North, I don't care for, so I'll begin here.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o2">"'The stag at eve had drunk his fill,</p>
<p>Where danced the moon on Monan's rill—'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Then she suddenly paused, "This is all in Scotland.
Do you know where Scotland is?"
</p>

<p>
"It is north of England."
</p>

<p>
"We haven't liked England over well. Grandmother
Marvin used to talk about the War of 1812, for
grandfather was a sailor and was killed. And there
was all the Revolution. Do you think we will ever
fight England again?"
</p>

<p>
"If we do we'll lick her again," I said with boyish
American grit.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't mind war against the Indians," she
said slowly. "And I do hope England will stay over
the other side of the ocean, and—Norman," hesitatingly,
"did you ever see a real deer?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes. That's where they get venison steak."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, now, I will begin again."
</p>

<p>
She read very clearly and with the appreciation that
gives the listener an insight into the real meaning. I
could not have gone to sleep. The chase stirred all my
blood, but I was glad the deer escaped. The lovely
lake among the mountains, the maiden in her skiff, the
encounter, the guidance, the enchanted hall, the welcome
to the unknown knight of Snowdoun, and the
promise of the song. Why, I remembered lines of it
and said myself to sleep with them.
</p>

<p>
"That is the end of the first canto. Next Sunday
night you shall read. It sounds like music, doesn't
it?" closing the old book.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I assented. It still rang in my ears.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was a shuffling and stamping at the door.
Mr. Gaynor beat out his old hat on the post.
</p>

<p>
"Jerusalem! The old woman's feather bed has
burst open this time, I guess. Why, you can't see
your hand before you. I've been in snows before, but
this is about the worst old tougher I ever encountered.
Norme—" he had taken up the familiar name—"thank
your stars you are this near the warehouse, if, indeed,
you can get there at all to-morrow morning. But I
don't suppose there'll be much trade," with a short
chuckle.
</p>

<p>
I knew that was an invitation to stay all night. I
had stayed twice before in a pouring rain.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let's see!" Ruth sprang up.
</p>

<p>
But as she opened the door a swirl of snow flew
nearly across the room, and she staggered.
</p>

<p>
It took both of us to shut the door and then we put
up the bar. For a few moments it was a primitive
cyclone. Ruth brushed the snow out of her hair and
eyes and laughed. Mr. Gaynor stirred up the fire.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you're satisfied. You saw the snow," he
said jocosely.
</p>

<p>
The wind swept about with a murderous howl as
only a western prairie wind can. A flock of wolves
could not have equalled it in the shrieks. Then there
would be a long bay like that of some great hound, or
a mocking whistle as if the fiends were abroad. We
really could not talk. Mr. Gaynor helped himself
liberally to roasted corn.
</p>

<p>
Presently it died down and was solemnly still. The
Yankee clock on the corner shelf in the best room—John
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
Gaynor could not have lived without that—struck
nine.
</p>

<p>
"Time to be coverin' up fires," he said. "Sis, you
run to bed. Want to see the snow again?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do," with laughing persistence.
</p>

<p>
He opened the door cautiously. The great white
sheet was like a wall. You could not see it stir at first,
but there was a muffled sound in the air, an indescribable
sound almost like the echo of music miles and miles
away.
</p>

<p>
"It is wonderful!" the Little Girl said, her eyes like
a clear midnight sky. "It is a strange world, terrible
sometimes, too."
</p>

<p>
"Better spread that wolf skin over your bed," her
father advised as he returned her good-night.
</p>

<p>
I crawled over to the back part of John Gaynor's
bed, though there was a great mound of feathers between
us. People were hale and hearty in those days,
if they did sleep half buried in feathers. But it
seemed to me all night long that I heard the
melody of the little girl's voice in the sweetest of
cadences.
</p>

<p>
It was the first big snow of the season and now it
was mid December. One had to begin at once to dig
out window shutters and doors, but as the doors
opened on the inside they were more manageable. It
was still gray and cold and one had to be muffled up
to the eyes. We shovelled a path out to the road, then
threw it this way and that until it was a decent level
and hammered it down with a shovel. Then we took
the back to the pigpen. We heard the grunts, so they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
were not frozen. Indeed they had a tolerably warm
home provided for them.
</p>

<p>
Ruth made pancakes. Mr. Gaynor had quite a large
round ring of iron that one put on the coals. The pan
stood on the top of this; a good big pan it was, and
the batter was poured out of the pitcher. Ruth liked
small, dainty cakes, her father enjoyed them about as
big as a dinner plate. He had a curious knack of
turning them without flopping. He liked them quite
thick as well, so he baked several first.
</p>

<p>
"Those little fellows ain't a mouthful for a good-sized
man!" he declared. "'Twould keep you eating
all day."
</p>

<p>
We had fried pork besides, and it was wonderfully
good. There was "long sweetenin'," a thick sort of
molasses. Sometimes we had a kind of maple sugar
syrup. Ruth and I baked, and then we sat down to
eat, and told over the funny sayings that we could
recall. It was very jolly.
</p>

<p>
The wood was piled up in a sort of lean-to at the
side of the house, so I brought in a supply of that.
We went out in the street again and a few pedestrians
were snowballing each other. A sort of drag with
four oxen came along to break the road a little. The
town looked like a nest of small white beehives. The
snow had blown off the trees, and they stood bare and
black against the sky, the finer branches as if traced
by a pencil.
</p>

<p>
I thought I would venture down to the warehouse,
but I had not gone far when I met one of the clerks,
who reported everything "stiller'n the grave," so I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
turned about. We played high low Jack, and then I
took up "fox and geese" with Ruth, who couldn't see
why I should beat whether I was fox or geese. So to
her great delight I let her pen up the poor fox, while
her father sat by and smoked his corn cob pipe. Then
we shelled a lot of corn, and had a late dinner of fried
chicken, at which Mr. Gaynor tried his hand, and it
was excellent. I thought I should like to see my
father undertake to cook!
</p>

<p>
Afterward I declared I must go home.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why do you?" asked Ruth pleadingly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to wear my welcome out, I want to
come again."
</p>

<p>
"He ain't likely to, is he, Sis? Seems to me his
folks might spare one boy when they have so many.
Let's toss up a cent to see which one. This is for
Homer."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want Homer," with pretty petulance.
</p>

<p>
"Ben or Chris?" He was twirling the penny in his
fingers.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want any boy but Norman."
</p>

<p>
"And up at Hubbard's they have a mortgage on
him. They're trying to teach him how many black
beans make five."
</p>

<p>
Ruth knitted her pretty forehead, then said disdainfully,
"As if he didn't know!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, if a pig can eat a bushel of corn in
twenty-four hours, how much fat will it put on his
bones? This is a matter of great importance to Mr.
Gurdon Hubbard. I think he has offered a prize for
its solution," and he winked at me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"A pig couldn't eat it," she said; "he would be a
hog."
</p>

<p>
We both laughed at that.
</p>

<p>
"Now, young fellow, if you get lost in the snow,
don't blame us. We've given you fair warning. 'Tain't
likely the house will blow over, seeing as it stood the
gale of last night. And, reely, I don't believe it will
rain to-night and loosen the underpinning, and there's
enough to eat."
</p>

<p>
In spite of this friendliness I had to tear myself
away. But I did get stuck in more than one pile of
snow and twice had to fight my way through showers
of snowballs.
</p>

<p>
We never saw clear ground again until March.
There was not much business doing and the men
gathered in the warm taverns to play cards and swap
stories and demolish political candidates, and praise or
blame Old Hickory, as the President was termed who
had fought his country's battles and served her for
nearly eight years in the highest civil capacity. That
the country would go to ruin without him was surely
predicted; that he had brought her to the verge of ruin
the other side claimed.
</p>

<p>
Every few days I was at the Gaynors', but the Little
Girl had given up school. She knit stockings, she
sewed and cooked, and we both concluded "The Lady
of the Lake" was the loveliest of all lovely stories.

<h2>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
A POLITICAL DIFFERENCE
</h2>

<p>
Spring came at last, though some of us almost longed
for the frozen paths when we sank inches deep in the
mud. We really were a city now and had a mayor
about whom there was still some contention. He had
been elected by the small majority. There were many
citizens who objected to this step and even then
aldermen were looked upon with some suspicion.
Where was the money to come from for all the improvements
planned? We were going along comfortably,
why not let well enough alone?
</p>

<p>
There were a few sidewalks, but the streets were a
terror until they settled a little. The wind helped;
there were times when it swept from the prairies and
brought the inspiration of the far west, the promise of
what could be done shortly, visions of acres of wheat
fields that were to be powerful rivals to peltries and
furs.
</p>

<p>
It was absolutely funny sometimes to hear the old
men talk who gathered about the wharf or strolled
round the warehouse, which was stretching out as well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
as running over. We, engaged in the heart of things,
had our hands full, and were not likely to "creak in
the j'ints" for lack of exercise.
</p>

<p>
"This 'ere Hubbard 'lows he knows most every
thin'," old Hiram Green would say, "'sif the Lord had
gin him a kind of far-off sight and called him into
council t' settle things. Ther's some freightin', but he
didn't diskiver it. Fore he was born things come down
from Detroit an' Canady. 'N I've hearn tell that some
old Frenchman talked this canal business long time
ago. Ther's nothin' new under the sun—Solomon said
so—an' 'though I don't hold altogether to Solomon, he
had a clear head there. Canal'l never be built more'n
I be made over. Sho now! Country was good enough
forty year ago, when you could get your livin' huntin'
and fishin' and were livin' neighborly round the blockhouse."
</p>

<p>
"Ye ferget the Injun raids," said Abe Byers. "Had
to git yer scalp fasten'd on tight every mornin' er cut
yer hair short. An' what's livin' wuth if yer ain't improvin'?
We want a good clear run to the Mississip—"
</p>

<p>
"An' be holpen them ther' towns all along the river.
Ther's Saint Louis an' Kasky an' Cahooky an' down to
Noo Orleens, all them ther' places to the east that are
braggin' theirselves up, and we'm goin' to be jest a
sort o' isthmus between this and that," balancing his
hands one way and the other. "All they want is er
right o' way jest to tromp thro' us, to buy things down
yender and sell 'em up ther'," nodding his head. "An'
who gits the money? I declar' to man I ain't seen a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
dollar in so long that I'm 'feared I should drop dead
if one kem my way."
</p>

<p>
"We can't spare you yit, Hi' Green, so we ain't goin'
to put that ther' kind o' sacrifice in your way," laughed
a good-natured man. "Some day when you're 'bout
a hundred they'll be writin' a story of Chicago,
an' they'll want to know these 'ere old facts. So
you jes' keep 'em safely stored in that brain of
yourn."
</p>

<p>
"Can't many remember furder back?" returned the
old man, somewhat mollified. "I've hearn granpop
tell 'bout that old black fellow thet come from some
o' the islands down 'bout Gulf o' Mexico with his
injun wife when ther' were only a few tradin' cabins,
an' ther' land was free for anybody who could give a
string o' beads to an Injun."
</p>

<p>
"Beads won't pass muster now, and I wonder if
Pierre Menard didn't feel sick afterward when he
found what a good bargain he had unloaded on John
Kinzie. The Kinzie tribe will be rich enough presently."
</p>

<p>
"An' then'll come a flood er a fire and swoop down
on everything."
</p>

<p>
"But the land can't be burned up, and it isn't ginerally
drowned out. Prairie sand can lick up a good
deal of water."
</p>

<p>
I had been half listening to the rambling disputations,
and now I turned from my rough desk by the
window, which was simply a board with four legs, the
two front ones shortened, to Mr. Harris, who stood by
his, that was my admiration, though not long afterward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
it was donated to me and he had a much finer
one.
</p>

<p>
"Is it true that Menard was sick of his bargain?" I
asked doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"I believe he was," Mr. Harris laughed. "I'd like
to buy it now for fifty dollars. I don't believe he has
done any better. Le Mai, a French trader, bought part
of it. But Ouilmette's old house is still standing, stone
and logs and plaster."
</p>

<p>
Michigan Avenue came through it long ago. The
Indian wife was quite admired in her day, being tall
and straight, and though many white women could not
read in those times, she was both shrewd and intelligent.
</p>

<p>
"I must hunt it up," I said. The little girl was
always asking about old places and strange things
that we call legends now.
</p>

<p>
She had wondered about the name. I had inquired
of several. It was an old Indian appellation, it was
said, and meant "wild onion." Once the great Mississippi
was called Chacaqua or Divine River, and was
supposed to be under the care of the Thunder god.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is very pretty," she declared, "though we
do not believe there is a god for everything, and gods
living in various places."
</p>

<p>
"And another legend is that a great tribe of Tamaroras
always called their chiefs by this title 'Checaqua.'"
</p>

<p>
"That sounds much better than a fiery-smelling
vegetable," the lines about her mouth settling in a
smile.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"And among the Sacs it was the name of one
of their valiant warriors—'He that stands by a
tree,'"
</p>

<p>
"That is really fine. A tall straight Indian standing
by a tree! But you have few such splendid trees
as we have at home."
</p>

<p>
That was true enough. The cottonwood flourished,
but except for some miles eastward and a long distance
to the north there was little fine timber.
</p>

<p>
The Little Girl and I generally took a walk on Sunday
afternoon after the Sunday School ended. Some
of the churches had a sermon afterward, the Methodists
had theirs in the evening. It was quite nice
walking now, and gardens had been put in orderly
trim. We hunted up the old Ouilmette cabin, now a
heap of ruins. The family had dispersed. But Mr.
Kinzie had made a very home-like place of the old
estate.
</p>

<p>
"Sometime we will go and ask him to tell us about
those old times," I said.
</p>

<p>
Then there was Dr. Harmon's. That was really
fine. A sod fence had been put up around it and he
had planted fruit trees and blossoming shrubbery and
made a pretty park of it. People often strolled along
this south path to the settlement just to view the
beauty.
</p>

<p>
Householders were beginning to cultivate flowers
somewhat, and roses were trained over doors and
porches. But the Little Girl sighed for the wild flowers
of her native State, many of which I knew nothing
about. I used to like to hear her talk of the trailing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
arbutus and the violets that sprang up among the
grass.
</p>

<p>
She began to go to school again. One afternoon in
a week she came over to our house and mother taught
her sewing and spinning on the little wheel. She
always stayed that night and my brother Ben grew
almost as fond of her as I. Dan noticed her now and
then, but she was quite too small for him. He was a
great favorite with the older girls, and was always
asked to their merry makings.
</p>

<p>
"I do hope he will marry young," said mother. "I'm
tired of such a lot of men kind about the house, an'
the way they go through stockings! The heels look
as if they had been gnawed out by rats."
</p>

<p>
She had a way of cutting them out, picking up some
stitches and knitting in new heels. Ruth thought this
a great achievement and wanted to learn how.
</p>

<p>
"'Twould bother your little brains out," said mother
with a sort of amused kindliness.
</p>

<p>
"Are my brains very small?" she asked gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Not smaller than common. You're only a little
girl. You'll grow."
</p>

<p>
"And my brains will grow too? Then I shall know a
great deal more. Suppose one didn't have any brains?"
</p>

<p>
"Then he'd be an idjit. Most people have some,
but they're not always put to a good use. Don't you
worry, little one. You'll have brains enough."
</p>

<p>
My father, too, grew fond of her, and I think was
pleased to have her ask questions. It always seemed
to me the house took on a different aspect when she
was there and the boys were more gentle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gaynor had planted his prairie strip with wheat,
and was surprised at its astonishing fertility. Even
then in a very dry time we practised a sort of irrigation,
wide spaces being left where you could drive
oxen and a hogshead of water through, letting it run
out plentifully.
</p>

<p>
One of the next things that attracted attention was
the raising of pigs. Freighting up the lake and to
Buffalo continued about as before. Everything else was
at a standstill. Not only was the Presidential election
approaching but that for representatives. Stephen A.
Douglas and John T. Stuart were competing candidates,
and stumped all the sparse towns where there
were any voters.
</p>

<p>
Davis was most complimentary to the new town,
and even predicted "that the children of to-day would
see a city of fifty thousand inhabitants before they
died."
</p>

<p>
This was received with yells of derision and much
shouting of the catch words of the day.
</p>

<p>
"Town lots! town lots! Shortest route through to
China. Will it be duck or drakes?"—in reference to
the mud and a slight hit at the men.
</p>

<p>
Even the women quarrelled about their candidates
and for weeks would pass each other by with disdain.
Harrison was one of the heroes of the Indian wars—what
had Martin Van Buren done to commend him to
the patriots of the country?
</p>

<p>
We sat out on the doorstep one evening. Mr.
Gaynor was down to the old Green Tree Tavern,
though now it had taken on the more dignified appellation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
of hotel. Quite a party of Whigs assembled
there.
</p>

<p>
"Norman," the Little Girl began after a long silence,
"are you a Whig or a Democrat?"
</p>

<p>
"I"—I seldom thought of politics except to be
amused at the old men "jawin'" about it when they
hung around the warehouse and passed opinions on
the boats and the truck.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you must be one or the other," a little
severely.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't need to until I am twenty-one. I can't
vote before that."
</p>

<p>
"But you can make up your mind."
</p>

<p>
"Father is a great Jackson man. He would not
mind if they put him in again. And he has been a
brave soldier. Look at the Indian wars, and that
splendid battle of New Orleans! And Dan believes
in him. They don't seem to know much about this
new man."
</p>

<p>
"Father is a Whig. I am too," holding up her head
proudly. "They are the party that wanted us to be
free of England, and they fought for liberty."
</p>

<p>
"I think there wasn't much difference of opinion
then. They were all patriots."
</p>

<p>
"Then how did they come to differ?"
</p>

<p>
"Well—" I really did not know, and hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"The Whigs don't believe in slavery."
</p>

<p>
"Father doesn't either," I said with a touch of
triumph.
</p>

<p>
"And there are a good many other things. They
have a hero for a candidate, while the Democrats have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
put up a dandy, who curls his hair and scents his handkerchief."
</p>

<p>
Many puerile objections were made to the Democratic
candidate.
</p>

<p>
"But he has been in the Senate, and he has been
Minister abroad—to England, and <i>is</i> a gentleman," I
retorted.
</p>

<p>
"Why do we want a Minister to England?" she returned
with a sort of royal indifference. "Tell me
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Countries always send Ministers to each other.
There are questions coming up all the time that have
to be settled."
</p>

<p>
"I thought everything was settled in the last war."
</p>

<p>
"I'll try and find out. I'm paying more attention to
business than to politics. And there are two sides to
everything, to all great questions."
</p>

<p>
I thought this was rather a fine way of ending the
argument. Then a quick step came pattering down
the board walk.
</p>

<p>
"I declare the good Lord never said a truer thing
than that he made man upright and he sought out
many inventions. I'm not quite sure the Lord said
that either. I haven't read the Bible much latterly, but
'pears to me there's no end of foolish and dishonest
inventions when a man talks politics. There's been
the greatest lot of idiots up there to-night. If I didn't
know more than some of 'em I'd hold my tongue forever.
I don't have much to say in this crowd anyhow.
'Twouldn't be quite safe, seein' as I'm a Yankee. I'll
do my part when voting comes, and I ain't bragging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
about it, either. Votes can talk then. Hillo, young
fellow, I believe your folks are on the other side. Well—we'll
just pass the time of day till the new man
gets in. I've observed then the political pot simmers
down wonderfully and you can shake hands across it
without getting steam burned. Good-night, I must go
shut up my chickens."
</p>

<p>
I was standing up. "And I must go. Good-night,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
She had been sitting on a little bench inside the
porch. Now she rose and shook the curls out of her
eyes, and responded in the coolest fashion.
</p>

<p>
I walked away rather dazed. It had not occurred
to me that anything could happen between the Little
Girl and myself. And why should we be less friends
for the sake of two strangers who were really nothing
to us?
</p>

<p>
Father and Dan were coming in the opposite direction
and we just met at the path to the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Where you been, Norme?" Dan inquired roughly.
"With that ther' blasted Whig from Yankeeland, listenin'
an' believin' all sorts of lies. See here, you're
born of good, staunch, Democratic people, and you'll
vote that ticket when you're of age er I'll know the
reason why," and he seized me by the ear.
</p>

<p>
"Dan!" exclaimed father, in a stern voice, loosing
his hand, "you've been drinking too much whiskey.
I'm ashamed of you! You are taking just the way to
make people despise the Democrats. Go to bed and
sober up and don't let me see you in this condition
again or I'll horsewhip you. Not a word, sir."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Dan went shuffling off, grumbling to himself.
</p>

<p>
It was no uncommon thing for young men to drink,
but the self-respecting class was seldom drunk.
</p>

<p>
"I wish they'd put a President in for ten years,"
said father angrily. "I don't know but we will begin
to fight each other pretty soon. Let Dan get asleep
before you go upstairs, and don't make no note of it in
the morning. Dan's a nice lad, generally speaking."
</p>

<p>
"What is the great difference between the parties?"
I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Well—I'll be hanged if I know, only 't seems as
if men wanted to make it wider all the time. Ther's
high and low tariff, and I can't tell which is best.
Then ther's slavery, and northern Democrats are pretty
much agin that. And money—one paper says one
thing, one the other. Both men are good enough fur's
I can see. From the bottom of my soul I wish Tippecanoe
had been our candidate and a Democrat. Ther's
the battle of Miami Rapids and Tippecanoe and Fort
Meigs and the Thames. He's a good, brave soldier,
and he's shown a wise head about Indian affairs and
such, and he's been to Congress. I'd like it to be so
you could vote for the best fellow. But it's party,
party. Thank the Lord you're not old enough to have
anything to do with it."
</p>

<p>
Dan was all right the next morning, but not as
boisterous as usual. I went over to the warehouse in
a rather troubled frame of mind, with a misgiving that
I had been warned on both sides. At our nooning
hour I questioned Mr. Harris about the merits of each
party.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You'd better read up history and the Constitution
and the Declaration of Independence, and see where
you come out. I guess there'll always be two parties.
Now England's a monarchy and there's two parties
there. Sometimes one rules the House of Commons,
sometimes the other. But it is a queer thing that reforms
start with the weaker party and have a hard
time to get a hearing, but they grow and grow, and
one is always a check on the other. Yes, you're old
enough to begin to understand some of these things,
but don't get to be a rabid politician, or you'll be
served with walking-papers;" and he laughed.
</p>

<p>
Thursday Ruth Gaynor went home direct from
school and did not take her sewing lesson.
</p>

<p>
"I do wonder what has happened to Ruth," mother
said when I came home to supper. "Was she well last
night? You were there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she was well. She did not say anything
about not coming."
</p>

<p>
"She'll be in then to-morrow, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
I had a guilty feeling. What if it spoiled the friendship?
I wanted to go down at noon, but pride held
me back. She was more than any political feeling—why
for her sake I would have been Whig or anything.
</p>

<p>
I saw her in Sunday School and my heart gave a
great bound. Hers was a girls' class across the room.
She had on a white frock and a pretty white ruffled
sunbonnet. The lesson dragged, the singing lost its
melody, but at last came the benediction. The children
loitered in little groups outside. I hung back, glad to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
talk to a boy about muskrat trapping. Ben went up
to her boldly.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you come? We missed you so.
Mother couldn't think what got yer."
</p>

<p>
"Got yer," she returned with a soft little laugh.
"What kind of an animal is it?"
</p>

<p>
Ben's face was scarlet. We were used to the town
vernacular, which was a conglomeration of Virginia,
Kentucky, trapper and rough boatman's speech, as is
often the case with immigrant tongue. She was
dainty in all she did and said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know what I mean," with a protesting
boyish gesture. "Come home with us now. Even pop
wondered what if you were sick."
</p>

<p>
"No—I was busy. I was trying to do—some things,
and—"
</p>

<p>
I came around the other side, and gained courage
enough to look in the sunbonnet. A tumultuous color
hovered over the sweet face, the lips had fluttering
curves, the long lashes glittered with the light shining
through. I could not have put it in words, but it was
one of the remembrances I set along side of my first
glance of her. Her hand hung down by her side, a
slim little hand, not much sunburned. She kept her
fair complexion through wind and sun.
</p>

<p>
A sudden accession of courage seized me, and I
caught it very gently. It was not withdrawn, and my
heart went up with a bound, though she was answering
Ben.
</p>

<p>
"You'll come home with us now. Coax her, Norme.
Ther' was the grandest chicken potpie for dinner, an'
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
some left, an' I picked berries for Mr. Kinzie, an' ther's
lots of 'em left. They're lickin' good."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be so economical with your letters, Ben,"
she returned drolly. "And what is lickin' good?"
</p>

<p>
"As if any one with half a wit couldn't guess!"
returned Ben with a very red face. "Why, when you
want to lick off your lips and your fingers, maybe,"
emphasizing the words he seldom took the trouble to
pronounce correctly. "And—the batter left in the cake
dish, though Chris always seizes on that now."
</p>

<p>
She gave a soft ripple of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Say—" Bessie Hale pushed in front of us, a big,
energetic girl with reddish hair and flaming red
cheeks, fanning herself with the skirt of her frock—"ther's
goin' to be a frolic out in the woods if they can
git things and folks together. Take your dinner an'
swings put up, an' race an' run, an' have a good time.
I heard Mis' Eastman talkin'. It'll be all planned out
by next Sunday an' word give out. All the boys an'
girls an' mothers an' gran' ma'ams, and jes' to have
fun all day long."
</p>

<p>
I had heard a whisper of it, and some dissenting
voices among the stricter ones as to whether it really
was religious. Camp meetings had been held, but a
picnic!
</p>

<p>
All the group of children talked at once and kept
going on in a huddle until a few discovered they were
in the wrong direction, and then thinned out reluctantly.
We kept so close to Ruth that, in a manner,
we impelled her to turn up our street, though it looked
not much more than a lane.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mother sat out on the bench in a white sort of
short gown with a ruffle about the neck, and a rather
coarse white muslin apron, but she looked cool and
sweet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ruth," she exclaimed. "I was afraid you were
sick or something. What happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you miss me so much? I am afraid of being
a trouble sometimes," she returned with a delicate evasion
that I noticed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you needn't be; that's some of your father's
notions. An' a girl without a mother needs a lot of
training, though I must say you do pick up things
mighty easy. Oh, boys, don't eat her up jes' if you
hadn't had a dinner."
</p>

<p>
"If you poured some milk over her you could eat
her up," said Chris, laughing, "an' some sugar on top
of her head."
</p>

<p>
"Think of the sticky mess in my hair!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you'd jes' dissolve an' be like—" rolling his
eyes about to assist his brain in capturing a comparison—"like
a lovely pudding."
</p>

<p>
"What an idea!" and Ben made a wry face.
</p>

<p>
"Bring out a stool," said mother. "So M'liss Hatch
comes now. Is she good for anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I like her ever so much. Aunt Becky grew
very cross and she and father had some words, and
M'liss likes to show me about things. We have real
good times when I'm home from school."
</p>

<p>
Mother nodded. "She goes home at night?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"She's got a beau. Pa'son Walker's 'visin' young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
people to marry, an' it does smart up the young fellows
and keep them out of taverns. An' then they get
thinking 'bout a house. Well, you jes' make the most
out of M'liss. Is your father's garden turning out
much? We've had quite a dry spell."
</p>

<p>
"Father had it all wet one day. Yes, it is in good
order. I hope next year we'll have ever so many
berries."
</p>

<p>
"Chicago won't ever be the garden of the Lord, but
Adam an' Eve were turned out of that. Even a
thistle wouldn't grow here unless you planted and
watered it. What people ever see in this place to come
an' settle passes me; an' ther's so many splendid places
in the world where things grow fairly wild. I don't
wonder people sell out an' go away."
</p>

<p>
"We're going to be a big port sometime," I announced.
</p>

<p>
"Sho, that's the men's talk. I've heard men talk
before. Where's all the people comin' from, I'd like
to know? To hear em brag sometimes you'd think
they'd be crossin' the Rocky Mountains 'cause there
wasn't any room on this side!"
</p>

<p>
Mother threw back her head and laughed.
</p>

<p>
Father was walking up the path and then she declared
she must get supper.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let me put on the dishes," and Ruth rose, hanging
her bonnet carefully on a wooden peg.
</p>

<p>
Father greeted her cordially and said it had been a
full month since he set eyes on her. We all filed indoors,
even to the big tiger cat, who kept following
Ruth about wistfully. The boys never tormented him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
when Ruth was around. They came to the table with
cleaner hands, and were much more mannerly, I
noticed.
</p>

<p>
We had a rather jolly meal even if it was Sunday.
Afterward we sung some hymns. Mother was very
fond of them. Then I walked home with Ruth,
though Ben glanced at us large-eyed and wistful.
</p>

<p>
"Were you very—very much affronted?" I asked,
as we were nearing her house.
</p>

<p>
She seemed considering.
</p>

<p>
"Because," in a hurried voice, as if I wasn't quite
sure I was right—"I've thought it over. I'd just as
leave be a Whig as not."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't like you to quarrel with father."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to," I protested earnestly. "And—I
want to be good friends."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I want us always to be good friends," and the
strong sweetness of her tone enraptured me.
</p>

<p>
She held out her hand, and so we renewed our
friendship.

<h2>
CHAPTER V
<br />
OF COMMON DAILY THINGS
</h2>

<p>
The picnic was a grand event, a new sort of entertainment.
Some distance to the southeast was the nearest
real woods about us. Here and there would be a belt
of scrubby pines, good for little besides firewood, or
a group of cottonwood trees. But this might justly
be called a forest.
</p>

<p>
Tree planting had aroused no especial interest except
the fruit and shade trees in some of the newer
residences. A wide clearing was considered a greater
protection in the earlier days, as one could sight roving
bands of Indians when there was nothing to shelter
them.
</p>

<p>
One would have thought from the discussions that
the question of salvation was imperilled by this new
form of dissipation. Still the day was carried for it,
and some of the old people and most of the provision
went out in great ox carts. But the children and
young people did not mind walking and were full of
spirit and eagerness.
</p>

<p>
I managed to get off for half a day. Fortunately,
the sun went under a cloud now and then, for which
I was thankful as I hurried along. And when I came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
in sight I stood still a moment with a strange awe,
touched by the beauty of the scene. The trees had
grown up tall and straight, with no troublesome underbrush.
The branches made arches overhead and
waved to and fro against the sky, that in most places
had a background of faint gray, where darker clouds
went drifting over it, or here and there parted to show
a rift of blue. I did not know about dryads or wood
nymphs in those days, but the figures flitting about
gave me a curious unreal sense, as if they could
scarcely be human beings. As I came nearer the
hum of the voices and the swish of the two swings
through a clear path, barely escaping the rugged tree
boles or a drooping branch, mingled with the shout of
some daring boy who twisted a little and escaped
damage.
</p>

<p>
There had been a fire built, and the uprights with
the crotch were standing but the crosspiece had
caught the blaze at last and fallen except at one end.
A heap of ashes, and charred sticks lying about the
edge looked rather melancholy, yet I had seen the like
many a time when a band of roving Indians, tired with
a long journey, had stopped to cook a meal. There
were groups of women together, some of them with
babies, and others with their knitting, while they sang
the hymns most in vogue at that day. One haunts me
through all this lapse of time:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Am I a soldier of the Cross,</p>
<p class="i1">  A follower of the Lamb,</p>
<p>And shall I blush to own His cause</p>
<p class="i1">  Or fear to speak His name?"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
and it always suggests those old pioneer missionaries
of the Roman Church, who braved all dangers and
even death to carry the Gospel to the Indians of the
far west.
</p>

<p>
The children were having a grand time, as I both
heard and saw, as I came nearer. They were playing
"tag," from point to point, running in and out in a
fashion that might have designed a labyrinth, groups
sitting on the dry leaves playing mumble peg, a few
big boys outside tossing up pennies. Then a girl holding
some of her compeers in awe with a ghost story.
What an odd, pretty picture it was!
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Norman, I was afraid you wouldn't come,"
and a gentle step ran up behind me and caught my
arm. I had been peering about for her.
</p>

<p>
"It is a long walk," I said, "and through the heat."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but it is lovely here. Oh, you'll want to sit
down and rest."
</p>

<p>
"That ain't a bit fair, Ruth Gaynor! You'll break
up the play."
</p>

<p>
"Here's Betty March—she'll take my place."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, you're very fine going off with a boy.
Betty don't know how to play."
</p>

<p>
"If it's telling riddles, I guess I do," rather indignantly,
returned Betty.
</p>

<p>
"But it's guessing them."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe that'll puzzle me. I've heard every
riddle in Chicago."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! Oh!" exclaimed a dozen voices in chorus.
</p>

<p>
We passed on.
</p>

<p>
"I've had a nice, nice time. Do you want to swing?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No," I returned. "Let us find a cool place and
sit down."
</p>

<p>
There were older couples who had achieved such a
search and were enjoying it evidently. We plunged a
little deeper in the forest.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do love trees so much, a great woods full
of them. I wish they grew up all around the town."
</p>

<p>
I was used to its barrenness, but the beauty and
awe of this touched me. A woodpecker ran up and
down a tree, surveying it with his beady black eyes
and drumming with his bill. Then he paused, turned
his head this way and that with a dainty sort of assurance,
and suddenly drew a worm out of his snug nest
and away he flew. We looked at each other and
laughed.
</p>

<p>
Then a squirrel came scampering along and eyed us
suspiciously, but as we did not stir he grew braver.
How pretty he was with his bushy tail like a waving
plume.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wish I had a bit of bread," cried Ruth, "I
have two quite tame ones at home. They beg so
prettily that I love to tease them a little, and sometimes
I hide the bread to see them hunt for it. They have a
home in that old gnarled tree. I found it out one
time, and I was afraid the cat would get at them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they would fight the cat if she poked her nose
in the hole."
</p>

<p>
"I hope they would."
</p>

<p>
Great black ants scurried about this way and that,
listening or thinking, it seemed, and occasionally one
dragged a burden as big as himself. What queer people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
they were! And, later on, when I came to know more
about them, I was filled with a curious admiration.
</p>

<p>
The soft wind cradled in the green branches murmured
its wonderful song, the keynote to so many
melodies. It seemed as if we had gone into some enchanted
country.
</p>

<p>
"It is a real forest," she said musingly. "And now
one need not be afraid of Indians—" yet she peered
about suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"But there might be a bear," I said, teasingly.
</p>

<p>
"A bear!" Her eyes were large with fright and she
caught my arm. "Are there really bears—"
</p>

<p>
"There was one not so very long ago. He made
havoc with some pigs and the men turned out for a
bear hunt. You see there's no hiding place for them
on the prairies, so he ran off into these woods, and they
caught him indulging in a comfortable rest. But he had
sharp ears and when he found he was pursued he
climbed up a tree."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that was bright and funny too," laughing.
</p>

<p>
"But a few shots dislodged him. There was quite
an excitement. So we had plenty of bear steak."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, poor fellow," pityingly.
</p>

<p>
"And they dressed the hide and gave it to the
mayor—a real native robe, not quite a buffalo,
though."
</p>

<p>
"Did any others come?"
</p>

<p>
"To the funeral? Oh, no. He must have strayed
away from his compeers. But there are plenty of
wolves."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes, father killed one in the winter that was
prowling round."
</p>

<p>
She leaned her head down on my shoulder. How
lovely and peaceful it was. I could have drowsed off,
but a voice roused me.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth, Ruth Gaynor?" with a boyish cadence.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," opening her eyes, then listening. "That's
Ben's voice, isn't it? I promised to walk with him if
he would swing the children. Can't we three walk together
if you are rested? And I believe I went to
sleep. Norman, this wood is like reading beautiful
poetry. Oh, do you remember 'The Lady of the
Lake'?"
</p>

<p>
"Ruth Gaynor?"
</p>

<p>
She gave a pretty call as we rose. Then glancing
around, we started toward a little opening and presently
heard a crunch on the leafy turf, and discerned
a figure going in a direction that would have taken
him quite by us, only I called, rather against my will.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Norme! When did you come?" He certainly
did look disappointed.
</p>

<p>
"Not long ago," I said. "How splendid it all is!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I haven't had much of the splendor, gathering
wood and waiting on mother and the women and
swinging children. You better go and do some of the
work."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I just came for pleasure. Remember, I'm in a
stuffy warehouse six days in the week."
</p>

<p>
"Well, ain't I in school an' chopping wood an' bringing
water and hoeing weeds and busy enough, I can
tell you. I'd like to be down there among the boats.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
An' I'm tired. I've been hunting these woods all over
for you."
</p>

<p>
"Several squirrels found us and some birds came and
sung to us. Well, let us sit down again. Poor tired
Ben!"
</p>

<p>
Her tone was very sweet with no mockery in it.
Ben dropped at the foot of a tree and stretched himself
out. What a big boy he was getting to be!
</p>

<p>
Ruth sat down near him, I on the other side. She
delicately pushed the hair from his warm forehead and
smiled in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Did you swing all that little crew?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and twice as many more. I think there are
four hundred children on this picnic."
</p>

<p>
"Half of the children in Chicago. How do you suppose
we found enough for them to eat?"
</p>

<p>
Ben laughed with restored good nature. He was
never cross long at a time.
</p>

<p>
Then they began to relate the funny mishaps, and we
did not lack for merriment. Ruth had so many shrewd
comparisons. But a group of children found us out.
</p>

<p>
"They want us all to git together," announced a
shock-headed boy. "Mr. Walker's goin' to hev' a
meetin'."
</p>

<p>
They were gathering from near and from far, like
Scottish clans. Mothers hustled their families together.
Teachers called the scholars in groups and
made sure of their number. The baskets were put in
the ox van and some cushions to ease up the joints of
the old ladies. The remnants of cake were distributed.
Then Mr. Walker gave out a hymn. In those days
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
they were sung over so often, at least the favorites
were, that every one knew them by heart. With what
a shout it went up there at the edge of the wood. Then
a very earnest, thankful prayer for the pleasure of the
day, another hymn and the line began to form.
</p>

<p>
It had been a success to judge from the happy faces
and joyous, if tired, voices. Plans were made for a
much greater time another year.
</p>

<p>
The sun was slowly sinking into that wonderful
west, and filling the sky with the red gold glow of later
summer. The wind breezed up and brought freshness
from the great lake, that now and then seemed a
molten sea. It stirred every pulse within me.
</p>

<p>
Presently Ruth's step began to lag. It was growing
dusky, and I slipped my arm around her waist, sometimes
almost lifting the tired little feet off the ground.
</p>

<p>
"I've had such a good, good time," she whispered,
"but the best was to have you come out. Only—hadn't
you better let Ben walk out home with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why?" in a tone of decided objection.
</p>

<p>
"I can't just tell. It is one of the things you feel.
He would like it. And you can come in to-morrow
for dinner."
</p>

<p>
That would compensate, but there was no need and
I was secretly glad. Mr. Gaynor was there waiting
for her with his mule cart, and I think the weary Little
Girl was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
That made a fine break in the everlasting political
talk. No one was dreaming of Woman's Suffrage
then, but the weaker sex were as strenuous for their
favorite as the men. For a little while they forgot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
even him and enjoyed spiritual conferences, went to
prayer meetings and exchanged experiences, sang
hymns about their work.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me no one was very clear about the
issues. General Harrison was a decided favorite, and
even now it seems a matter of wonderment that he did
not go in by acclaim. We of the frontier had a
stronger regard for him than the Eastern States.
They were more cultivated and leaned to the social
instead of the military aspect.
</p>

<p>
There were quarrels and not a few open brawls
where pistols were used. Then came the great day of
voting, and whiskey and betting were rampant. Chicago
had improved a little on the old time, when all
letters and news had been brought from Niles, Michigan,
by a hardy half-breed, only once a fortnight.
Still, the tidings were slow in reaching us. And when
it came—Martin Van Buren was elected President of
the United States of America. There was great rejoicing
among the Democrats. Bonfires were built out on
the prairies; they were forbidden in the town.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, there were a number of laws termed "The
Ten Commandments," though some of them were not
kept much better than the Mosaic Code. Pigs were
not to wander in the streets, men were not to shoot off
firearms in the limits, but they did. A stovepipe was
not to run through a board partition, as if the city
fathers had a premonition that fire would some day
work a havoc. There was to be no horse racing in the
streets, cards and dice were not to be played in taverns
after ten o'clock.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I was much interested to know how Mr. Gaynor
would take it. He was by no means a red-hot politician,
and though he had decided views he seldom allowed
himself to wrangle, but turned off an argument with
a joke or some humorous comparison.
</p>

<p>
"Pity it isn't spring," he said dryly, "for then we
could go to work and be sure of a long summer. Now
we will be frozen up before you know it. I s'pose your
folks are shouting. Well go ahead and have all the
hurrahing that you can. It's a long lane that hasn't
any turning, and ours has been pretty long. I think
I see the turn four years ahead," with a funny twinkle
in his left eye.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that the President has so much power,"
I subjoined. I belonged to a debating society now,
and we were discussing the affairs of the country.
"He <i>can</i> veto. Then he has a cabinet to advise
him—"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he doesn't when you come to that, but I observe
that he has to shoulder the blame of an unfortunate
administration. I wouldn't give a fig for your
President, but I do hope Congress will do a little for
us. Those Eastern fellows haven't an idea of what this
section is going to be. They think they have the whole
Atlantic Ocean and trade, and some day we'll have to
feed them, keep them from starving. Why, the wheat
fields will be the wonder of the world fifty years
hence."
</p>

<p>
He was buying prairie land and seeding it to grain,
planting corn and feeding pigs.
</p>

<p>
I remember his telling mother one time about election
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
cake that the Eastern housekeepers made to treat
their friends.
</p>

<p>
"'Twould take a mighty sight to go round here,"
said mother.
</p>

<p>
I was amazed to see animosities settle so soon and
the men who had threatened to "blow off each other's
heads" smoked the pipe of peace around the tavern
stove. They were really country taverns, where neighbors
came for a friendly gossip, even if they did drink
a little whiskey and bet on a game of cards.
</p>

<p>
I think Mr. Harris was very much interested in
furthering my turn for knowledge. He lent me books,
he asked me to spend the evenings with him. He had a
nice cheerful room with a married sister. He had
several volumes of poetry that I borrowed for the Little
Girl. Oh, what delight we took in "Percy's Reliques"
and some of the old ballad singers!
</p>

<p>
She grew very slowly, it seemed to me, but then we
were such big fellows. Homer went to a carpenter to
learn a trade, building being considered a very good
business. He was fully as tall as I, but he had no
especial taste for books, though he was very quick
and ingenious, and full of fun and frolic. There were
dances once a fortnight in one of the rooms at the old
fort, which was put to various uses, now that the Government
had removed the troops. The court was held
there, commissioners met to confer and ordain, pay
taxes and make complaints. Everybody had a curious
sympathetic feeling about it, as if it was in some sort
a monument that commemorated the massacre. For
some time after the treaty, when the Government
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
purchased their lands, they distributed goods to the
Indians every year. This was on the prairie, on the
west side of the river, and we used to make it quite a
holiday. The Indians sat around in a circle with the
squaws behind them. There was a great pile of goods
which the traders and some of the half-breeds began to
distribute. At first the row of Indians was quite
orderly. Then dissatisfaction would begin and they
would rise to their knees, gesticulating and vociferating
their mixed gibberish until it seemed they might
break out into open war. Then there would be a general
scramble, the squaws throwing back articles they
did not care for and seizing a lot, that, perhaps, gave
them no greater satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
The day ended by a big fire kindled far enough from
the wigwams to escape the danger of conflagration,
and the braves would dance around it in a furious manner.
Occasionally there were brawls for several days,
which culminated in killing a number, and many of the
braves would part with their goods to whoever would
trade whiskey for them, though this had to be done
underhand.
</p>

<p>
All Chicago was glad and relieved when they were
removed to their allotment. Forty ox teams carried
the children and the baggage, while the braves and
squaws marched leisurely, encamping for the night,
and were nearly a month reaching their journey's end.
</p>

<p>
We were not rid of all the Indians, however. There
were some who preferred semi-civilization and
whiskey, and not a few half-breeds whose descendants
were to be proud of their Indian blood in after years.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
There had been mixed marriages, mostly French traders,
with Indian wives, and some of these made worthy
citizens.
</p>

<p>
One of the Ottawa chiefs, who had prevented a
massacre, after the defeat of Mayor Stillman's force,
still remained in a noted place called Shabbona's Grove.
Shabbonee kept the respect and friendship of the
whites, and was quite a power in quelling disputes
among his own nation. While most of the savages in
our vicinity were not such as to inspire one with even
tolerant sympathy, he was more like the heroes of
romance that have been handed down to us from our
forefathers. A broad-shouldered, stalwart specimen
of his tribe, with a more intelligent face and strength
of feature and character than even the average.
</p>

<p>
Times were very hard and through the winter little
could be doing. Plans there were in abundance. Men
lingered in the warm shelter of the warehouse and
wrangled, of course. I think now it was the foreshadowing
of "bulls and bears" that were to dominate
the town in the years to come. One party drew
roseate pictures of the possibilities of the coming
Chicago. We were to be the centre of trade—we were
between the east and the west, not only that, but there
was Canada and the lakes and the mineral wealth of
upper Michigan, the boundless prairies.
</p>

<p>
And the others sneered at the mud hole and saw
dozens of ways in which trade could be diverted. The
canal wouldn't ever be finished, the towns along the
Mississippi had the start of us and would keep it.
Cities would spring up along its banks as if by magic.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
There was the gathering trade centring in the mighty
gulf, the outlet to France and England, even to the
Coast States. What could we produce to compete with
them! Would the great cities of the east be generous
enough to fall back and beckon us on? Trade looked
out for itself first of all.
</p>

<p>
I used to repeat these arguments to Mr. Gaynor.
Sometimes when he wanted to go out of an evening
he asked me to drop in so that Ruth would not be left
alone. The handmaid, Melissa Hatch, had married
and rejoiced in a two-room shanty of her own, but did
not disdain coming in for a few hours daily and taking
the rough work. They were rather gay and spent their
evenings card playing and dancing with their neighbors.
Fiddling was a common accomplishment. The
dancing was more of the jig, or breakdown, order.
Two people would dance to each other, executing all
sorts of fancy steps, then turn to the next couple and
pair off, and so on until they had gone around the
room. If there were not more than four people they
seemed to have just as merry a time. Then a little hot
whiskey, and to home and to bed. No midnight dissipations
for them.
</p>

<p>
Not that Mr. Gaynor was given to these festivities.
He would go over to the Tremont or to Baubein's and
listen to the talk, now and then putting in some shrewd
remark or a bit of humor, and often caught an idea
that he saved up for future consideration, and when the
time came used it and made a success of it.
</p>

<p>
"All this talk doesn't bother me," he would say
dryly. "New land's the place for fine crops. To the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
eastward you have to pick stones until you feel as if
you had a ball and chain to your leg. Land's getting
worn out, too. Some day they'll have to come to us
for bread. They can't farm and manufacture at the
same time, and they're just besotted on building towns
and calling in people to work in factories. All well
enough for those who like it, but these people will all
have to be fed and some one will have to raise the
stuff."
</p>

<p>
He was a typical Yankee for barter. He always had
something the neighbors wanted, or could give assistance
when it was most needed and take it out in something
else, for there really was no money. He raised
excellent stock. He looked at a thing, a pig or a pile
of boards, or even a bit of land, squinting up one eye,
and saw its good points at once. And he managed to
keep on the right side of every one.
</p>

<p>
So I spent half my time at the Gaynors', mother said.
Dan was a gay young chap in great demand with the
girls, ready for any frolic, and already was the owner
of a fine horse that he was very generous with when he
had time to drive, and the girls were ready to tear each
other half to pieces for the chance.
</p>

<p>
"I jest wish he'd settle down to one," mother would
say complainingly. "There's no look when a fellow's
butterflyin' round. He ain't like a bee who has some
sense, but jest goes from flower to flower, an' that's
the way with Dan. I ain't no ways anxious to have
Polly Morrison for a daughter, but I did settle upon
it a while ago, an' now it's Betty Hale, but it does
seem as if some girl might catch him an' sober him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
down. He's smart to earn, but he'll never be forehanded
until some woman gets hold of the purse
strings."
</p>

<p>
Early marriages were quite in vogue, the general
trend of new countries.
</p>

<p>
I did not have to consider the point, for twenty-one
was early enough. And I was more interested in
books than girls in general. I was not much of a
dancer, and I think I was a little afraid of the quick,
saucy retorts of the girls. I liked the sledding parties
in winter and the skating. We even navigated about
on snow shoes, and it was very exhilarating when there
was a sharp crust frozen over the snow. On clear
moonlight nights there was an indescribable splendor
in the far sparkling reaches, whose only limit seemed
the boundary of the blue sky, studded with brilliant
gems of all colors, it seemed at such times, and changing,
as if no settled tint predominated, as the air went
waving among them, driving a flock here as if they
were birds of mystery, then confronted by some daring
immovable fixed star. I used to stand in silent
wonder, they were so marvellous.
</p>

<p>
"And to think that heaven is behind them all," the
Little Girl would say with grave eyes.
</p>

<p>
We were a good deal troubled with wolves and now
and then there was a regular hunt. Dan was always
delighted with such adventures. Some more valuable
animals were captured as well.
</p>

<p>
But spring came on amain, and curiously enough,
business seemed stirring up in spite of hard times and
money disturbances. The people of Chicago were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
workers. They began to look after the streets a little,
to straighten the houses that had been set in every
fashion, and though there did not seem much of
promise to call them thither, emigrants were arriving
nearly every day in all sorts of vehicles, and of several
nationalities. The French had quite a little settlement
to themselves, Germans began to look for outlying
farms, some had already bought Government land.
There were still Indian wigwams, in which squaws
labored and pappooses abounded.
</p>

<p>
And though it was not a highly diversified country,
and many things were left for the hand of man to accomplish,
still it took on a certain beauty. The broad
belt of timber to the west stood up sentinel like, to the
south there were various rises of ground; there were
the broad prairies and the magnificent lake, beginning
to be dotted with vessels of all the rather primitive
kinds. The building of the Clarissa had been considered
a great achievement, and was being followed
by others.
</p>

<p>
Gardens came out in summer bravery. Many of
them were an acre or two in extent. Apples and plums
grew readily, indeed it seemed as if plums were indigenous
to the soil. Smaller fruits were cultivated,
and all those not likely to be killed with the hard cold
winters.
</p>

<p>
Here and there you saw prairie schooners, as they
were called, with a double team of oxen lumbering
along with a load of logs from some more favorable
point for the saw mill. Wheat fields waved in the sunshine,
making billows like the sea. Cornfields green
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
and strong shot up like armies. Rye and oats—everything
grew as if by magic. Doors were wide open, and
women sat spinning, or some one ran to and fro with
nimble feet at the big wheel.
</p>

<p>
In another house was a loom, the warping bars hung
with skeins of colored yarns, and the ceiling of the
homely interior still ornamented with the remnants of
winter provender, where there had been abundant storing.
Children played around outside, older ones went
to and from school, raced about in childish games,
handed down from generation to generation. A
neighbor woman in a faded blue gown and sunbonnet
stopped to gossip awhile at some one's door as to who
was "keepin' stiddy comp'ny," who had been buying a
cow or putting up a shanty, or "dyein' of ther' yarn."
Less than three quarters of a century ago they had
dreams of greatness then, but they would have fainted
to see this day.
</p>

<p>
The Little Girl had learned to spin and had a wheel.
She had learned many other things as well, and some
of the older people thought she was "fittin' to keep
house a'thought any help." But M'liss was glad to
come in daily, though now she brought a small
bundle, rolled in an old shawl, which she generally
deposited on a bench and stood a chair-back against
it.
</p>

<p>
"I jest useter think it was orful to strap them little
Injun babies on a board an' hang 'em to a tree, but I
dunno. They want ter be made straight, an' fraish air
is good fer 'em. I s'pose people'd think I was orful
unhuman to do it, but lawsy a' massy me, what does
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
anything like that want but jest to lay still an' grow
till it gets some sense."
</p>

<p>
Ruth was not enchanted with the baby, though she
berated herself for a kind of hard-heartedness. It had
a funny little face screwed up to a point in the centre,
with a sloping forehead and no chin to speak of, and it
was a curious red brown.
</p>

<p>
"'Tain't no great beauty," M'liss admitted. "But I
never see one that was. Ther's a big world fer 'em to
grow good lookin' in if they hev the gift, an'
if they hevn't, why, they hevn't, thet's all. I can't say
I was eszatly hankerin' fer it, but it's here, an' sent
fer some wise perpose, mebbe."
</p>

<p>
M'liss was very glad of the good meal and the chunk
of pork or loaf of bread she earned. The Little Girl
only went to school for half a day now, she was learning
so many useful things at home to make her her
father's housekeeper. He was always very tender to
her I noticed, and thought her very smart.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when we sat on the doorstep of an evening
he would join the talk. His father and grandfather
had been Revolutionary patriots. He had been
to Boston and sailed from there to New York and
back, and knew a good deal about the geography of the
Eastern States. I brought out my store of knowledge,
gleaned from traders who stopped at the warehouse.
Some of the stories seemed too marvellous for belief,
and now they are commonplace history.
</p>

<p>
The only thing Ruth was really slow about was
figures. Mr. Gaynor was very quick and could not
seem to understand it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You must learn," he would say. "I may get old
and lose my eyesight, then you'll have to do my
clerking."
</p>

<p>
So we used to labor with her. She knew her tables,
children learned them perfectly in those days, but there
was some little knack of applying them in which she
seemed deficient. And when we were alone she would
say:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't bother. Let us read. When I am grown
up it will all come easy enough," and her winsome
smile always persuaded me.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Harris had loaned me "Pope's Iliad," recommended
it to me, in fact. When I had gone about half
through I was so enchanted that I brought it to
her, and turned back that we might share it together.
How wonderful it seemed to us! We took it
in as every word true. These were the people
who lived long before America was discovered,
long before William the Norman crossed over to
Britain.
</p>

<p>
"But I do wonder if men must always fight," she
said with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
We were at peace then except for an occasional
Indian skirmish, but these glowing descriptions did
stir my blood.
</p>

<p>
Then there was an old copy of the "Morte d'Arthur"
that we revelled in. And there were outside enjoyments,
rambles about on Sunday afternoons that we
did not keep as strictly as the people to the eastward.
Mr. Gaynor was full of funny stories about the old
blue laws, as they were called, of having a hen put to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
death because she laid an egg on Sunday. But one
that amused us very much was the old couplet:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The deacon, he whipped the barrel of beer</p>
<p>Because it worked on Sunday."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
There was some splendid birch and sassafras beer
made in many families, and though there was a good
deal of whiskey used, numbers of the best men
frowned on habitual drinking.
</p>

<p>
One of the great amusements on Saturday afternoon
was horse racing. This had to be outside the
town. It created immense enthusiasm. Several of the
young Indians owned fine horses and were proud
enough of them. Dan entered his beautiful Chita, and
after some training and several attempts she won a
race, to his great delight. We had gone out, and I must
say my inmost heart was stirred at the sight, but I had
not thought the laurel wreath would descend to us. It
was a perfect ovation. And that night he came home
much the worse for drinking, and he and father had
quite a desperate quarrel.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to shoot the mare!" declared
father.
</p>

<p>
"He'd move heaven and earth to get another," and
mother put her arm over father's shoulder. "Dan is
a pretty good boy in the main, and I'm hoping he will
get a wife some day to steady him."
</p>

<p>
"Polly Morrison!" flung out father scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"No, I hope it won't be Polly Morrison."
</p>

<p>
Polly was a slim, lithe slip of a girl that no two
people ever agreed about. Her skin was of lily fairness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
no matter what she did. Her eyes were large, and
although glorious does not seem the proper adjective,
that is what they were. Brown, with golden lights
that could flash and laugh and turn so tender, you were
sure they were in tears. She had a rather wide mouth,
full of curves and dimples. The one thing that laid
her open to criticism was her hair. Somehow red hair
was not in high favor, and though her admirers
quarrelled about it, red it surely was, the deep rich sort
of mahogany red, with a gloss as if the sun shone upon
it. There were great waves from the white parting to
the coil which covered the back of her head. Occasionally
she shook it down, and it was a glistening
cloud about her, looking like something alive. She was
a harum-scarum sort of a girl, could row equal to a
man, ride bareback, run races, dance like a creature
bewitched, go to church on Sunday and look as demure
as a saint.
</p>

<p>
That summer Chicago was all astir. It didn't matter
to anybody whether Martin Van Buren was President
or not. There were processions of grain coming in,
ox loads, precursors of trains that no one dreamed of
then, bringing it in sheets and blankets, begged of
the housewives when bags were filled, and there was
the crude elevator, the grain hoisted by hand with
block and tackle, and dumped into the hold of the big
Osceola. Twenty-nine hundred bushels to be sent to
Black Rock, New York State, the beginning of the
mighty contribution that was to enrich not only the
city, but the east as well, and in future times to stand
between the world and starvation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Crowds went to see it. How proud everybody was.
John Gaynor rubbed his hands in glee.
</p>

<p>
"What did I tell you!" he kept saying in triumph.
"This will sometime be the great city of the world, and
those blasted fools at Washington can't see that we
need anything, not even to have the canal finished.
Well, we will surprise them yet."
</p>

<p>
He was not much given to swearing, though profanity
seemed rather in the air. The good parsons
preached against it, and some of the best men rarely
used an oath.
</p>

<p>
For days nothing was talked of but the exploit.
The Osceola had gone off with the cheers of the
crowd. But when the jubilation subsided a little,
new plans were made for the elevator to use
horsepower instead of hand, and to enlarge its
capacity.
</p>

<p>
Crops of all kinds had been good. The yield of corn
was tremendous. Pigs were in demand; there was
plenty to fatten them. We were almost as likely to
have a boom in these products as there had been
in real estate a few years before.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dole had been slaughtering and packing cattle
of both kinds down on Dearborn and South Water
streets. The small log building where he first lived
stood three doors east of the warehouse, but now he
had built a more commodious dwelling. Mr. Thompson
was in his new office and still busy surveying and
mapping out lots, and making trades that, as father
said, kept the log rolling without any money. Mr.
Thomas Church had enlarged his store, and the women
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
had a gala time going to see the pretty things every
few months when a new stock came in.
</p>

<p>
The older inhabitants still kept to weaving linsey
woolsey and common grades of woollen, as well as
some of the coarser cotton cloths. Spinning and knitting
was much in vogue, but the girls beginning to
grow up rather protested against the labor. And the
goods coming from the States and abroad were so
pretty and tempting. So butter and eggs were bartered
off, strong sacking stuff, pork and woollen stockings
for the boatmen and the voyagers.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carpenter was building a fine house over on
the west side and setting out choice fruits that stirred
others up to emulation. Then we had a daily paper,
the <i>American</i> having started a precarious venture that
most men predicted would be a failure, and "where
could any one find news enough to fill up a daily
paper?" was on the tongues of the objectors. It might
not have been the highest intellectual pabulum, but we
were not educated up to that mark, and somehow we
took to the effort most cordially and wondered how
we could have done without it.
</p>

<p>
"You can't wash out a hankercheer now an' hang
it on a bush, a'thought everybody knowin' it," grumbled
Grandmother Green, "an' I kin hear all the news
I want on prayer-meetin' night. I hain't got no
money to go foolin' round stores an' other people
wouldn't 'nother if they paid ther' just debts."

<h2>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
THEN THE UNCOMMON
</h2>

<p>
That autumn a theatre was opened on the west side
of Dearborn Street, over a general store, a plain,
wooden building. The second floor was seated and a
stage erected with rather crude paraphernalia. It was
called the Rialto. A Mr. McKenzie was manager and
stage director, and some very good plays were given
with William Warren, Mrs. Ingersol and Mr. Jefferson,
with little Joe in his first attempts. They had very
fair audiences, and it was a step above the card playing.
There were also some lectures given, and several educational
plans brought to the fore. If they were to be
a great city they must rouse themselves on every
side.
</p>

<p>
I went to the theatre with Ruth and Mr. Gaynor.
He, it seems, had seen several plays. Ruth was
curiously interested.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it is like what people say and do all the
time," she said with a rather puzzled air. "Not as
funny as some of the stories they tell. And somehow,
you seem to lose the thread. You want to know what
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
they did in between. I believe I'd rather read the
whole story."
</p>

<p>
I began to be curious about Shakespeare's plays, and
talked them over with Mr. Harris.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you want to read them aloud to a little girl,
I will let you have Charles and Mary Lamb's stories,"
he said. "You will enjoy them better."
</p>

<p>
And enjoy them we surely did.
</p>

<p>
But one night we had a great alarm. There had
been occasional fires, still so many of the houses being
small and detached no great harm had been done. But
the Tremont Hotel took fire, and though strenuous
efforts were made to extinguish it the men soon found
their labor was in vain. Then the near-by houses began
to go and terror filled everybody. Those at a distance
started to carry out their choice belongings that
they had worked so hard to accumulate. Near-by
houses were demolished in the hope of staying the
flames.
</p>

<p>
We were safe enough, but I had some fear for the
Gaynors, and ran over as fast as I could. The streets
were packed with people pushing, shouting and swearing,
and if noise could have deadened the flames the
brilliant sheets and spires would soon have turned to a
dull smoke. I pushed my way along, once encountering
Dan, who struck out at me, which I dodged.
</p>

<p>
"You start home, youngster, 'fore you git hurt,"
he cried, but the next moment I was lost in the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
I could not think the Gaynors were in any real danger,
and they were not. M'liss had run up with her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
baby in her arms, while her husband had gone to the
fire, and they were standing in the small front yard.
</p>

<p>
"I declare to man! How did you get over here?"
ejaculated John Gaynor. "Now that you are here I'll
just take a stroll over and see the damage. Splendid
sight, if it wasn't burning up what 'twill be hard
to get together again. You can't make much out
of ashes, though it's mighty good for growing
corn."
</p>

<p>
Ruth clung to me. We talked this night over years
afterward, when we were fleeing from an awesome and
terrible army of flames that seemed bent upon our very
lives.
</p>

<p>
"Will there be any one burned up?" she asked tremulously.
"If it wasn't houses, it would be magnificent."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," reassuringly. Then I felt I was not sure.
I had not thought of the sacrifice of human lives.
</p>

<p>
Out of the black smoke would shoot up a great spire
of flame, showering sparks like an immense Roman
candle. We knew little about fireworks then, but I
never see one going to pieces without recalling this
scene. Fortunately there was not much wind or all
Chicago would have gone then.
</p>

<p>
You could hear the roar and the crackle and it was
really frightful. She began to cry from overwrought
nerves, and I tried to soothe her. M'liss was full of
queer comments at which I had to laugh in the midst
of my anxiety. Then the baby woke and set up a howl.
</p>

<p>
It was after midnight when Mr. Gaynor returned.
The danger of the flames spreading had been conquered,
the brilliant blaze subdued from lack of further
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
food on which to vent its ravenous appetite. It was
now a thick black smoke that penetrated everywhere.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's something of a fire for a town like
this," declared Mr. Gaynor. "Awfully unlucky, as if
times were not bad enough without all this loss. It
will take years for the town to get over it. There's
eighteen or twenty houses burned besides the hotel."
</p>

<p>
We knew most of the owners, and certainly they
were deserving of sympathy. I stayed all night and the
next morning made one of the crowd gathered at the
ruins. Seventeen buildings had been burned and there
lay a long tract of cinders and ashes. The condolence
was sincere and offers of assistance hearty. The hotel
would be rebuilt as soon as possible. The courage
evidenced the indomitable pluck that was to be tested
more than once and show an undaunted front.
</p>

<p>
The ruins would be cleared away at once. More
stringent rules about buildings and fires were discussed.
There was a finer public spirit in all this. We
were to be a town of note presently. The canal came
up again for a more earnest share of attention. Streets
must be improved, wharfage extended, better docks
built—they were very crude indeed.
</p>

<p>
But winter settled in and most of the improvements
had to stop. There was no end of trouble about money
matters. The State banks suspended payment. One
could never tell just what the money of any other State
would be worth. The new President had brought no
especial prosperity such as his party had predicted,
and some of his warmest adherents denounced him—as
if he alone shaped the policy of the Government.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Little Girl and I did not meddle our heads about
any of these things. I could see that John Gaynor,
in a certain way, was getting to have quite a place in
Chicago affairs as far as advice went. In other matters
he kept closely to his own business. He picked
up pieces of property, giving oftentimes labor, or
grain, or pork in exchange. Game was plentiful if
you went far enough for it. Often a party of men
would go out for a three or four days' hunt and come
home laden with spoils. Still, there was a demand for
domestic poultry and eggs, and Gaynor's stock of all
kinds was considered first class.
</p>

<p>
He was out quite often in the evening, and I fell
into the habit of stopping as I came from work.
</p>

<p>
"Just take a bite with us, Norman," he would say.
"I'm going to Green Tree or down to Baubein's, and
I'll be home by nine. But I can't leave Ruth alone;
don't know but I shall have to hire you for steady
company," with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I ran off home after that, at others remained
all night. Dan was very gay and seldom in
before eleven. But as the Little Girl was too young for
dances or merrymakings we amused ourselves. M'liss
occasionally added to our fun by her droll experiences
and views on everything, in an uncouth dialect. Her
granny, now near a hundred, knew all about the first
people who came to Chicago, and M'liss sometimes
was very interesting, though I used to think granny
must have drawn on her imagination for some of the
tales, but they so captured Ruth's romantic side that I
let them pass.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At other times we read and really studied about the
different States. The Mississippi, with DeSota, La
Salle and Tonti, was a mine of treasure to her. Later
New Orleans, with its changes of government, Napoleon's
marvellous history and the purchase of the West,
was a great source of interest to us both. Mr. Harris
was my mentor. Between getting and giving I added
much to my incomplete boyish education.
</p>

<p>
But it was not all history. Every volume of poems
I met with I borrowed, and we read the old ones over.
I think we both knew pages of "The Lady of the
Lake," our first love.
</p>

<p>
One evening an odd incident happened to me that
in the beginning was rather a source of annoyance. I
was to go to Mr. Harris's and had a list of inquiries in
my mind to talk over. At the side of the cheerful fire
in the arm-chair with the high cushioned back sat
a gentleman of distinguished appearance that I had
caught sight of in the warehouse, a tall man with a
rather spare but not thin figure, a fine face that, no
doubt, had been handsome in youth. The forehead
was high, but rather narrow, the hair, that now had
only a few dark threads in it, but a certain silvery
gloss, an aquiline nose, and the beard, snowy-white,
trimmed in the Van Dyck fashion. The eyes held me.
They were large and dark, but with a kind of winning
softness. The eyebrows were still dark and so were
the long lashes.
</p>

<p>
"This is Mr. LeMoyne, Norman, and this," turning
to the gentleman, "is the young friend I was telling
you of."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He did not rise, but extended his hand with such a
grace that I felt self-condemned for my discourteous
thought.
</p>

<p>
"We have been talking about you," he began, and
there was something in his voice that completed his
sudden ascendency over me. "Mr. Harris was saying
you were much interested in New Orleans, and that
you had never seen any of our larger cities. I have
been in that quaint southern French town for some
months."
</p>

<p>
I knew I smiled with pleasure. There was such a
charm in his manner. But I felt tongue-tied, abashed.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot have much of an idea of it from this
place, except as Mr. Harris tells me that you are
almost in a sea of mud except when you are frozen up.
They have a great deal of it in the way of inundations,
and part of the city lies very low. But there is no real
winter and everything is abloom with roses. Such
luxurious trees, indeed all kinds of vegetation. It is
really a French city, much more so than St. Louis.
The States seem to have taken in almost every nation
and I wonder how they will assimilate them."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see the year 1900," laughed Mr.
Harris. "We are not half through a wonderful century.
It is not sixty years yet since we achieved our
independence, a few poor struggling colonies, and
already we are stretching beyond the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
"What madness took possession of France I can
never understand, except that she set out to rule men's
religious consciences while she herself plunged into
the depths of depravity. The Huguenots would have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
been a crown of enlightenment to her, and she
martyred them, cast them out, and then slowly followed
the loss of all this great empire, for which she
had paid so much in the lives of her finest and bravest
men. From New Orleans to Montreal!"
</p>

<p>
"Have you been to Canada also?" I ventured to
inquire.
</p>

<p>
"To Canada, to the cities on the Atlantic, to England,
France, Holland, indeed as far as Moscow, Constantinople
and the Mediterranean," and the smile he
gave me completed his conquest.
</p>

<p>
Then we went back to New Orleans with its French,
Spanish and Creoles living in harmony, its odd, narrow
streets, its great outlying estates, its sugar plantations,
its bloom and beauty until my heart was aflame
with a desire to see it. And its antithesis was Montreal,
Quebec.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me when the clock struck nine there had
never been so short an hour and a half. I knew I must
go, but it was as if some curious power held me back,
pervaded every pulse. I could believe in enchantment.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you have had a pleasant evening," said Mr.
Harris at the door, "and that it may lead to something
more advantageous."
</p>

<p>
"I can't express it," I returned bunglingly. "I never
heard any one talk so delightfully before, and to think
what Mr. Le Moyne must know!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed softly.
</p>

<p>
We were very busy the next day with some accounts,
and said nothing about the evening until lunch time.
I had brought mine. Then I heard that Mr. Le Moyne
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
was one of the partners in a large fur-trading company
and also in the new copper mining in Northern
Michigan, that was being rapidly developed. In his
youth he had fled from France to Canada in the time
of the Huguenot persecution, and had become deeply
interested in business later on. I was very enthusiastic.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I was glad to have you see him. Such men
are worth knowing."
</p>

<p>
It seemed quite absurd that I should ever have the
opportunity of knowing much about him. Men of his
stamp were not frequent visitors in our provincial
town.
</p>

<p>
If I had been enraptured myself I have no word to
describe Ruth's delight. After all, we were very simple
children, though our reading had broadened our
minds, and I had found before this that Mr. Gaynor,
indifferent as he seemed to what is called culture, was
a very well-informed man on general topics and
shrewd in his observations. I did not know then that
education was much more widely diffused at the East.
</p>

<p>
The outcome of this was a proposal I could not have
imagined. Mr. Le Moyne dropped in the rough little
office several times and we had a few suggestive talks
about business which seemed rather for Mr. Harris
than for me. One day my father was called into
council, which amazed me, for when he went out he
gave me such a mysterious look.
</p>

<p>
"We'll knock off now," said Mr. Harris. "There's
nothing to suffer, and I have a plan to lay before you,
an opportunity that doesn't happen more than once in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
a lifetime, and I hope you will take it. Your father has
given his consent."
</p>

<p>
The offer was from Mr. Le Moyne, who wanted
what would be called a private secretary nowadays,
perhaps a little more. With his perfect health he had
been seized with a mysterious eye trouble, a dimness
of vision that nothing could cure, but that rest and
carefulness would assist in putting off the evil day,
and that he might never be totally blind. He wanted
a young intelligent person who would be pleased to
travel, who would be companionable, who could read
to him, write his private letters, who was trusty, honest
and reliable, and who had the enthusiasms of youth.
He would give me a good salary and put me in the
way of making a fortune if I stayed with him. But we
would make our bargain first for two years.
</p>

<p>
I was absolutely speechless from surprise. My
brain was in a whirl. I was glad to have Mr. Harris
go on pointing out the advantages, though I am afraid
I could not have told one of them afterward.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" presently, in an inquiring tone.
</p>

<p>
"I am so confused," I began. "Of course it is a
splendid chance, only I had never thought of going
away—"
</p>

<p>
"Two years soon passes, and you may come back
before that. Mr. Le Moyne is a delightful gentleman.
If I was young I'd jump at the chance. Yes, I suppose
it is a surprise," with a little heartsome laugh.
"But you'll take it. You see it isn't even as if your
parents had no other sons. There's enough of you
boys to settle a town. One won't be missed."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Ah, but I knew one who would miss me.
</p>

<p>
I went home in a dream. Father had been telling
mother and Homer, who had wrenched his ankle skating.
The two boys were out snowballing.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's equal to a lottery prize!" declared
father. "Norme, some of your fine notions stand you
in good stead. I've sometimes thought with your
mother that you should have been a girl, but now we
see the sense of them. This Mr. Le Moyne wouldn't
look at a great rough lout. Well, if he'd laid a hundred
dollars in gold in my hand I really think I
couldn't be gladder."
</p>

<p>
"It's wonderful," said mother in a softened tone.
"I've jawed an' scolded at the way you boys run
through stockings an' wear out trousers, but I shall be
awful sorry to have you go away, only this is a chance
out of a thousand. But you c'n write, an' two years
isn't long."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I wish it had been me!"
</p>

<p>
"You!" cried mother with disdain.
</p>

<p>
"Homer's a smart lad in his way. I look for him
to build up half Chicago before he dies. They're all
good lads, if Dan is a bit wild."
</p>

<p>
We talked all the evening. Of course, there was no
refusing. The next morning Mr. Le Moyne came in,
and I signed an agreement to stay with him the two
years.
</p>

<p>
"That's to tide you over the homesickness at first.
I wouldn't give much for a lad who wasn't a
little touched by parting with his own folks. But
we will have some nice times together, and you'll
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
see a good deal of the world. I hope you'll like
me."
</p>

<p>
Like him! If it hadn't been for the Little Girl I
could have knelt at his feet for very joy and gone all
over the world with him.
</p>

<p>
I went to supper at the Gaynors'. Ruth had been
making Johnny cake, and it was delicious. She had
some funny sayings of M'liss' to repeat, and we
laughed, of course.
</p>

<p>
"Now that you're here I'll go down to Baubein's and
smoke an hour," Mr. Gaynor exclaimed, rising from
the table.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go!" I blurted out, and I believe I was almost
crying. "I have—something to tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing bad, I hope!" He studied me curiously.
</p>

<p>
I don't know how I told the story. It was all in
a jumble. He looked as if he didn't half believe me.
</p>

<p>
"Not that tall, white-bearded Frenchman, who
looks as if he had just come from a King's Cabinet.
Well, I swan! Norman Hayne, you're born for luck.
Give us your hand."
</p>

<p>
He wrung it almost off.
</p>

<p>
"I'll sit down and hear the story over again. That
Frenchman is said to be worth a mint of money, and
you're on the right side. You just keep there, with
care."
</p>

<p>
He made various comments as I went over the
happenings. Then he seized his beaver cap.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mind if I tell it?" laughing. "I know
just how a woman feels when she's dying to retail a
bit of gossip. But this is uncommon."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No," I replied, "I expect father's spreading it
abroad."
</p>

<p>
"So would I if I had such a boy." Then he went out
and slammed the door.
</p>

<p>
We stood and looked at each other. Ruth's eyes
filled with tears that slowly rolled down her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ruth, don't! don't!" I cried, and my arms
were around her. Her face was buried on my
breast.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how can I let you go!" The tender accent
pierced me to the heart.
</p>

<p>
It is curious what people do in times of great emotion
or anguish. She released herself presently, wiped
her eyes, and said, "We must clear the table. I am glad
you liked the Johnny cake."
</p>

<p>
"It was delicious, only I was so full of the—" the
bad news, I was about to say, but paused.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, it is splendid, and you will see so much
of the world. There are so many beautiful places that
we have read about. And it will be—Norman, you
will be a gentleman. But you won't—" her voice
trembled and broke.
</p>

<p>
"If you mean that I will not forget, you may be
sure of that, and I shall never outgrow anything, not
even dear old Chicago, even if other cities were paved
with gold," I replied emphatically.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing is but the New Jerusalem," she said
solemnly. "Whatever happens, we shall be together
there."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing will happen. I shall come back in two
years. Business may bring me back before that."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We washed the dishes and put them away. Then I
stirred the fire and we sat down side by side. How
often we had done it—two years—how long it
looked!
</p>

<p>
I loved her very much. More than ever I wished
she was my sister and that mother could watch over
her. She would gladly, I knew. A little girl, barely
twelve years old and not large for her age. Once or
twice a thought crossed my mind, but when I looked at
her it seemed sacrilege, like pulling the bud open before
it was ready to unfold. She was so sweet and
innocent.
</p>

<p>
I told her all I knew about Mr. Le Moyne, and how
he had really charmed me. "I should like to bring him
to see you," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I should be so glad!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gaynor came home, but he had not recovered
from the surprise. I loitered awhile, but I knew my
mother would be waiting for me.
</p>

<p>
I was quite a hero, I found. The older men congratulated
me, the boys envied me. Mr. Le Moyne was
very gracious and affable. He came and had a long talk
with mother and she was charmed with him. He went
to the Gaynors' with me and pronounced Mr. Gaynor
shrewd and intelligent. Ruth, he thought sweet and
pretty, but she was very shy.
</p>

<p>
Oh, how quickly the time sped by. A winter journey
was no light thing in those days, but Mr. Le
Moyne was well prepared and a seasoned traveller.
</p>

<p>
The good-bys and the good wishes were enough to
start one on a prosperous journey. And when I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
glanced back I saw my mother had the Little Girl by the
hand. They were the two dearest souls on the earth
to me. How would she look when I met her again?
Oh, what long, long years! Even then I could have
turned back gladly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
FROM THE LITTLE GIRL'S SIDE
</h2>

<p>
I was so lonely after Norman went away. I suppose
it had been almost like having a brother. Mrs. Hayne
and I went to see him start, and there was quite a
crowd of friends. The sun was shining as if it was a
May day, with that curious quiver in the air, and it
was truly pleasant. Of course, pinning our faith to the
Almanac, we could safely have said winter had come
to an end, but in Chicago March did not mean spring.
</p>

<p>
What a handsome face that Mr. Le Moyne had, and
his voice was so sweet as he said, "Never fear, he will
come back safe. You may see us both before you expect
it."
</p>

<p>
I suppose that was meant for Norman's mother, but
he gave me the smile as well.
</p>

<p>
"You had better come home with me," she said, still
holding my hand.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I can't," I replied. "I am mending some
bags for father. I couldn't finish them yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"These hands are too little to sew rough bags."
</p>

<p>
"M'liss is going to help me."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then, I suppose I must let you go. Come over
to supper, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I will see," but I felt my cheeks burn, for I really
did not mean to, much as I loved her. I did not want to
hear them talk about Norman and rejoice at his good
fortune. It was good, I know, but I was not quite
ready to be glad over it. I wanted a little time to get
my mind steady.
</p>

<p>
M'liss had the bags strewn around and the baby in
the midst of them. He really was growing better looking,
his chin was filling out and his forehead began to
be a little bump that broke the smooth descent from
the top of his head. But it seemed as if his mouth
grew wider.
</p>

<p>
"D'yr know what I've jest gone an' done? Yer pop'll
scold like fire 'n' tow, but that ther' bag jest wasn't any
bag at all but holes. 'N' I've jest took it to mend
t'others. Two patches an' that ther' little smitch was
all I could git out of it. Holes ginerally speaking
haven't much savin' grace to 'em. You jest can't convert
'em to anything."
</p>

<p>
I looked rather askance. Bags were bags in those
days.
</p>

<p>
"What yer pop wants is to git a piece o' baggin'.
Marty Pettingil's weavin' of it. For a good strong
heft o' corn er grain'll punch new holes in 'em
quicker'n wink. En ther's somethin' 'bout puttin' new
wine in old bottles, though I don't see jest why if you
leave stoppers out. Any fool oughter know enough
fer that. En patchin' old bags is like darnin' old
stockin's, tears out jest above en below an' all round.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
I put a patch on 'em now. That's an idee of my own
en saves a lot o' stitches. Them bags is mended."
</p>

<p>
I shook out two and laid them by. Then I brought
out a wolf rug and put the baby on that. He crowed
a little and then returned to his former employment of
gnawing his fist. "The baby is real good," I said.
"Does he ever cry?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lord yes! But he's findin' out that it don't
amount to much an' times whenst he's cross en don't
have stomach ache I hit him a good slap, en I give him
a piece o' pork rind to chaw on. It's good as a dose
o' ile."
</p>

<p>
There was not much science or sanitary knowledge
in those days. Yet children throve and grew.
</p>

<p>
I hunted up my work-box. Homer had made it,
though it was Norman's gift. We had pasted
some bits of pretty paper in most of the compartments.
</p>

<p>
"Now you jest g'long," said M'liss, brandishing her
formidable needle. "'Tain't enny kind o' work for you,
an Norme he stopped t'other night an' said—'You jest
do the hard things and chores, M'liss, to save her. She
ain't strong ernough to tackle 'em, an' I'll make it all
straight with you when I kem back.'"
</p>

<p>
"It was so good in him to think of that!"
</p>

<p>
"'N' if you want to work go out en hunt aiggs.
Caton's folks sent over. Two dozen ef you've got 'em
to spare."
</p>

<p>
I was very glad to do that. It was a mystery to our
neighbors how father could make hens lay in cold
weather. They had a good tight house for the night,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
and he seldom let them out until noon. We threw the
corn in on the ear, and it was quite fun to see them
tumble over each other to pick it off.
</p>

<p>
I only found fourteen, but I knew there would be
more by noon. How pretty and white they were,
almost like living things.
</p>

<p>
I took up my knitting. Men's stockings came up
over the knees then, and it was a good long stretch to
knit the legs. M'liss had pared a great panful of
potatoes, so I filled up the big kettle with water and
swung it over the blaze.
</p>

<p>
"Now ef you kin find a crust o' bread—I guess that
youngun's hungry, en I don't want no growlin'."
</p>

<p>
"Why, he can't eat bread with no teeth!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he kin gnaw it, en if he thinks he's gittin'
some it'll be all the same."
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't be for a hungry man," and I smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Land no! En if he takes after his father the Lord
help us! Jed Hatch kin eat mor'n any two men I
know."
</p>

<p>
The bags were mended and piled up in the out
kitchen. M'liss cooked the potatoes and fried the pork
while I laid the table. The baby rolled over asleep
with his crust still in his hand and his mouth. Father
came in and gave my cheek a soft pinch.
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid you had been crying your eyes out,"
he said. "Brave little girl, we'll miss him bad enough,
but it's such a fine chance and there's such a lot of
Hayne boys. Guess he's the smartest of the lot
though, where books are concerned, but it isn't everybody
that's wantin' book learning. Why, it's said that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
fine old fellow Mr. Le Moyne's worth thousands and
thousands!"
</p>

<p>
"I've been kinder respectin' yer feelin's," said M'liss
in a low tone "en thought I wouldn't say anythin'
about Norme goin' away, seein' as ye was sich
friends. Yer'll miss him jest orful, he was here so
much."
</p>

<p>
I winked hard to keep the tears back.
</p>

<p>
"Harris says they won't find another boy like him in
a hurry. I don't know what's got into boys nowadays,
they ain't worth their salt. Seem to think they
were put into the world jest to loaf round. That
horse-racing will be the ruin of them. I'd have it
stopped if I was boss."
</p>

<p>
I didn't so much mind the talk of boys in general.
Father ate a good hearty dinner and went off to work,
pleased to find the bags mended. M'liss ate her dinner,
fed her baby, washed the dishes and took some
potatoes home with her, though she "'lowed she'd stay
and company me if she hadn't promised to rub out
Mis' Crane's wash, seein' she had rheumatiz' and
wasn't strong."
</p>

<p>
It was a lonely afternoon, for I was thinking of the
evenings in all the two years to come. If I had a
sister! There were no girls near by. Over the other
side of the river there were so many of them and they
were always having such good times.
</p>

<p>
It was a long, long afternoon. I fed the chickens
and shut them up and then cooked the supper. We
were hardly through when there was a cheery whistle
in the outer kitchen and Ben Hayne came in.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Mother sent me over to say she was coming this
afternoon only Mis' Carpenter an' Mis' Wooley
come a-visiting. They are there yet. I was kep' in
school."
</p>

<p>
"Then you haven't had any supper. Come and have
a bite, though I expect you have lots of good things
at home."
</p>

<p>
People in those days made a great spread for company.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and stay a bit with Ruth while I go out and
smoke a pipe," said father.
</p>

<p>
Ben nodded and sat down at the table.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth," he began, when he had demolished a big
slice of bread, "I feel somehow as if there had been a
funeral. I s'pose it is 'cause we know Norme isn't
coming back in ever so long. But say, won't he have
just the beatinest time! We were looking up the places
on the map. Norme was such a good fellow. I'm
going to try to get in a store next year. Father says
I may."
</p>

<p>
"That will be a nice thing."
</p>

<p>
"And over here, too. Then I can drop in just as
Norme used to. Mother doesn't see what you're going
to do alone. She'll be over to-morrow. Wouldn't it
be a great scheme for you to move?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father couldn't move the ground and everything,"
I returned.
</p>

<p>
"No, I s'pose not." Then he laughed. "They're going
to move some ground though come summer to fill up
the slough. Dear me, I wish we had some mountains!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I could recall some mountains in the old State we
had come from, yet, somehow, I had begun to love
the long stretch of prairie.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me what you are learning at school," I said,
as I was putting away the supper things.
</p>

<p>
He was in full swing when there was a rap at the
door. To my great surprise it was Mr. Abner Harris.
He greeted Ben very cordially, and they began to talk
about Norman at once, and what a splendid prospect
he had before him.
</p>

<p>
"He is worthy of it, too," said Mr. Harris, "or I
could not have recommended him. I am about as
sorry to part with him as any one. I don't know when
we will find such another painstaking fellow. You
will miss him about reading, won't you?" turning to
me, "and I came over to say that if you'd like to borrow
any of the books I have, you'd be welcome to
them. My sister is going to call on you. Why, you
must get lonesome here with no one but your father."
</p>

<p>
"I've never had any one else," I replied, "and everybody
has been very good to me."
</p>

<p>
"And you are your father's housekeeper?"
</p>

<p>
"Partly a woman comes in to help."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were larger, older, though I have
never noticed you especially. Well, some evening I'll
bring my sister over. She has no children, to her great
sorrow, so you must make friends."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be very glad to," I said.
</p>

<p>
Father came in before he went and they had a little
talk, mostly about the good fortune that had befallen
Norman.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then we shut up the house and went to bed. Yes, it
must be something like a funeral. The body went out
of the house. I wondered how any one could bear to
have it put in the ground. Norman had read about
some country—I think it was Egypt—where they
built real houses for their dead and put in them the
things their relatives had used while alive, painted and
carved pictures on the walls and went in to see them
now and then. That seemed ever so much nicer than
lowering them into the earth.
</p>

<p>
"But Norman isn't dead," I said to myself, "and he
surely will come back." I ran it over in my mind.
Seven hundred and thirty days. Each day would
count.
</p>

<p>
I recalled the time I had first seen him and the warm
welcome Mrs. Hayne had given us after that long
journey. That was more than four years ago, and
then I laughed softly to myself—why he would
be away only half that time, and the four years
had not seemed long. So I dropped asleep quite
happy.
</p>

<p>
For some time I think I lived mostly in the past. I
began to go to school again. Spring came in early and
everybody was astir. Indians came down with pelts
they had gathered through the winter and there were
some wigwams put up out on the prairies where they
held powwows and dances and laid out in the sun and
smoked pipes. They were a lazy lot and they hung
around until all their money was spent. They were
paid largely in clothing, blankets and useful articles,
but they kept trading them off, and though there were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
some stringent rules about selling them any quantity
of whiskey, they managed to get it all the same. Then,
by degrees they started off north again to join their
brethren who objected to civilized life.
</p>

<p>
But there was quite a stationary residue. The
squaws seemed to improve much faster than the braves,
though they had all the hard work to do. They dug
up the ground and planted corn and other vegetables,
they dressed skins and made clothing and moccasins
and ornamental bead work, which they sold. Occasionally
some of the traders bought a store of it to
take to the eastward.
</p>

<p>
Father kept adding to his stretch of prairie land all
the time. He had the true Yankee thrift as I came
to know afterwards. Yet at this early date Yankees
were not held in very high esteem and peddlers were
rather tabooed. Indeed, at one time there had been a
license of fifty dollars exacted for selling wooden
clocks in the whole State. The law was against
"bringing in and selling." But the shrewd Yankee
evaded this by some parties bringing them in, and
quite another party selling them. So it was proved
that neither man was amenable to the law, which presently
fell into desuetude.
</p>

<p>
There had been another funny point in the license of
Mr. Mark Baubein when his ferry was first established.
He kept two racing horses and was very fond
of getting up a trial of speed with some of the young
Indians who were crazy over this amusement. So
he was ordered to ferry the citizens of Cook County
from daylight in the morning until dark without stopping,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
and the query was whether the citizens were
compelled to go without stopping.
</p>

<p>
The Tremont Hotel was being builded anew, and
some of the seventeen houses erected again. Much
more care was taken. There seemed to be a general
awakening throughout the town. Streets were lengthened
and Wolf's Point at the junction of the two
branches of the river did not seem near so far away.
</p>

<p>
There were public and private schools, the latter
being used mostly for girls. I began to make friends
with them, living over the river and going only
in pleasant weather had kept me out of their latitude
and influence. I had been rather a shy little girl and
Norman had been company enough. But I came to
have a wistful sort of longing for some of my own
kind.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hayne was very sweet and motherly. She
tried to persuade father to move over her side of the
river. It had the most advantages, she would argue.
</p>

<p>
"You wait and see," father would reply. "We're
going to spread out, I can tell you. There's room
enough for two cities, and I have so much outlying
land. I'm in for raising hogs now and I want plenty
of room."
</p>

<p>
Then he would look doubtfully at me and with a
half laugh say: "I wish I had two girls instead of
one," and I wished it as well.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Harris brought his sister to see us. She was a
Mrs. Chadwick, a very sweet, quiet-looking woman,
with none of the breeziness of Mrs. Hayne. Her husband
was very much interested in the government and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
improvement of the town, and as there were no public
halls the men generally gathered at some of the better
class taverns and discussed the public weal. Father
often went, though he did not take any active part.
Neither did Mr. Harris, for he attended closely to business
and spent his evenings at home.
</p>

<p>
"But what does your little girl do?" asked Mrs.
Chadwick. "Surely you do not leave her alone?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not afraid," I said. "I put up the bar and sew
or read until he comes home, or M'liss comes up and
sometimes the boys."
</p>

<p>
"Abner, we must have her up with us. I have no
little girls, but I think we could entertain you. We
have plenty of books to read."
</p>

<p>
"I'd be mighty glad to have you take her in hand,"
said father. "Mrs. Hayne's been like a mother, but
you see that's a good streak off, and when she doesn't
go to school it's rather lonesome."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you miss Norman very much," Mr.
Harris commented, "he was a nice steady fellow.
Dan's smart too, but rather wild. I don't know as this
town is the best place to bring up boys, but still we've
turned out some pretty nice men. I suppose there's a
time when most of them kick over the traces, but they
get broken in when they marry."
</p>

<p>
There had one letter come to Mrs. Hayne from
Norman. They were at Detroit and were going up to
the Straits. He had been very busy and a good deal
homesick, he admitted, but he liked Mr. Le Moyne,
and would never be sorry that he had started out in
life. There were so many wonderful things in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
world. At the Straits he would write more at length.
"Give my love to little Ruth," he said, "and tell her she
shall have a good long letter."
</p>

<p>
A week or so after their visit Mr. Harris came for
me. It was not very far. They had quite a pretty
cottage and a really beautiful garden. It was light
enough to walk through it, and I was delighted. I had
a vague idea that I had seen such gardens in our old
State. Great bunches of camomile with their snowy
disks and pungent odor, sweet Williams of almost
every color, a tall row of hollyhocks just coming into
bloom ranged along the fence, a bed of sweet herbs,
lavender, thyme, sage, and there had been roses. I
thought the most beautiful of all were the tall spikes of
pure white lilies that I had never seen before, but I
came to know afterward were annunciation lilies, and
I never see the Virgin with her branch of bloom but
it carries me back to that evening in the old garden.
</p>

<p>
The house downstairs had a sitting-room, a
kitchen with a sort of shed-room off, and a sleeping-room.
The first named had a fine rag carpet on the
floor of Marty Pettengill's weaving and several
boughten chairs that had come from Buffalo. Tall
brass candlesticks and a pair of curious bronze-like
pitchers with a gay-colored band about their necks and
an oval of a girl's face set in their sides, that always
interested me very much; a table between the windows
with a Bible and hymn book, and a somewhat tarnished
gilt frame mirror that broadened out at the top
with a sort of cornice that enclosed a picture that I
used to study of a young man in a boat and a girl just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
stepping into it. She held up a blue gown that was
meant for silk by the shine of it, and had the daintiest
slippered foot laced up over the instep with black cord.
I admired her very much at first, then I grew tired of
her, for I wanted to have her step into the boat and
see him row away.
</p>

<p>
Upstairs, where we went presently, Mr. Harris had
a sleeping chamber and what we might now call a
library, or a den. There was a pair of huge antlers
over the narrow mantle that divided off the fireplace.
There were several guns and powder horns and some
Indian trophies, and curious things I knew afterward
were lichens from forest trees. The chairs were
mostly homemade, and there was a box lounge with an
Indian blanket over it. In both corners of the chimney
from there to the wall were shelves with books and
various curiosities from many parts of the continent.
</p>

<p>
"Here's where Norman and I sat and read after I
found he had a liking for books," Mr. Harris said.
"Books are my choicest friends. You run to verses,
though, don't you?" looking at me. "I suppose that is
natural for girls."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know," interposed Mrs. Chadwick.
"When I was a little girl I just hated verses, perhaps
because I was compelled to learn them by heart, and
occasionally speak a piece for the entertainment of my
mother's friends. Stories were considered very demoralizing
and giving children and young people false
views of life. We were allowed 'Rosamond and the
Purple Jar,' on account of the fine moral."
</p>

<p>
She laughed softly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Rosamond—" I repeated doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, haven't you ever seen that?"
</p>

<p>
"No, ma'am," I admitted frankly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Abner, do read it to the child," she exclaimed
smilingly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Harris had lighted two candles and stood them
on a stand that I remember was painted green, and a
gay-colored mat on it.
</p>

<p>
So I heard Rosamond and her unwise choice. I had
seen some glass jars with colored liquid in them at Mr.
Carpenter's drug store, but I couldn't understand
even then how any one could make such a sacrifice to
possess one.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I should have found some poke berries and
mashed them up and put some water on them," I said,
"and there are dye stuffs—"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps poke didn't grow in Rosamond's country,"
said Mrs. Chadwick with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather had a jar of flowers, though that would
not have lasted," I added as an afterthought.
</p>

<p>
"And you do not like the story?"
</p>

<p>
"I think Rosamond was a foolish girl."
</p>

<p>
"So her mother thought, and she made her suffer
for it—learn by experience, as we say."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Harris laughed heartily.
</p>

<p>
"What else did you do when you were a little girl?"
I asked with some curiosity. It seems strange to one
in childhood that a grown-up woman could ever have
been a little girl.
</p>

<p>
She had lived in Philadelphia and been one of quite
a large family of plain Methodist people, almost as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
strict as Quakers. She had gone to Western New
York with a married sister and had met Mr. Chadwick
there and married him, and after they had moved
to Chicago her brother Abner had come out. Most of
the older members of the family were dead. Her
sister lived at Ithaca now and had quite a large family,
with some grandchildren.
</p>

<p>
I was wonderfully interested in these reminiscences;
indeed, I was quite captivated by Mrs. Chadwick. She
was very different from Mrs. Hayne, and I wondered
if it was not disloyal to like her so well. I understood
afterward that it was the difference made by education
and leisure.
</p>

<p>
It was a very pleasant evening and gave me some
new ideas. Mr. Harris brought me home. Father had
come back and was sitting on the doorstep smoking
his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"I was wondering if I had lost my little girl!" he
exclaimed with a short half laugh. "But I guess I
should have known where to look for her."
</p>

<p>
"We shall be very glad to have her any time," was
the response, "and you must not leave her here alone.
Not that there's anything to fear, but it's lonesome."
</p>

<p>
"I look out for that," and father nodded, drawing
me closer to his knee and tightening his arm about me.
We did love each other dearly, but people in that day
were not effusive. There was so much work to do in
the new countries that affection ran more to deeds than
words or caresses.
</p>

<p>
A few days after I had my grand, glad surprise—a
letter from Norman. From Detroit they had gone up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
to Marquette on Lake Superior, where there was a
great deal of business to straighten out and claims to
adjust. The world was wonderful and splendid. One
hardly had any idea of it in Chicago, and Mr. Le
Moyne was proving one of the most generous and
charming of friends. Norman was learning French.
It was almost universally used up there, and Mr. Le
Moyne was a great reader of French literature and
knew pages of it by heart. "I wish you could study
it, too," he wrote, and then he gave me places to trace
out on the map where they had been; and there was
the great Lake Superior and the Indian countries, the
most elegant furs one could imagine, and a variety
of strange and beautiful animals. The trading
stations and the small towns were so picturesque,
the people curious indeed. Altogether it sometimes
seemed like a dream to him, and he could not put half
the wonderful things in a letter. They were to return
to Detroit and I was to send a letter there and tell him
all about myself, and if I missed him very much, if
I took the old walks and read the old poems over, and
what I was learning.
</p>

<p>
At that period mails were slow and uncertain, and
letters were often sent by friends. An appeal had been
made to the general government, and Mr. Hogan was
postmaster, combining it with some other businesses.
The little old place was quite a rendezvous on mail day,
though no one was ever certain of that even. A row
of old boots nailed up for mail boxes created much
amusement. But mere friendship letters were a rarity.
Indeed, writing a letter was considered a great feat. If
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
one heard from friends once a year it brought
content. Postage was very high, and in new countries
money was scarce.
</p>

<p>
I labored over my letter, writing it first on various
scraps of paper, as I could think of things I wanted to
say. Books are written nowadays with more ease.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII
<br />
WITHOUT NORMAN
</h2>

<p>
It seemed suddenly as if Chicago took a great leap.
Perhaps the whole country was more prosperous. But
everybody was full of business, and immigrants were
pouring in at the rate of ten a day, the newspaper
announced. They were of all kinds. Some from
Virginia, many from the two States south of us, hardy
people with an uncouth dialect and new ways that were
more or less picturesque. The men had been great
hunters and could hardly adapt themselves to any employment
at first. The women were used to all kinds
of household work. They hetcheled flax and it was
very entertaining to me to see the mass swept across
the sharp wires and the person drawing her body back
with a monotonous croon, then starting forward again.
The soft silvery stuff was laid in a pile by itself, and
how beautiful it looked. The rough and coarse strands
were for common uses.
</p>

<p>
I could spin quite well now, but I used to love to
watch these other spinners with their deft motions.
The big wheel fairly fascinated me, and the nimble
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
running back and forth. The great dye tubs, too,
with their yellows and browns, blues, and reds and the
long hanks of yarn hung out in the sun, dipped over
and over to darken them until they made some really
handsome shades.
</p>

<p>
Besides these people there came quite a colony of
French in our neighborhood. I was glad of this,
though it seemed as if their "jabber" was too intricate
to be taken up by any native tongue. Their attire was
much more picturesque than that of the Kentucky
women, and they disported themselves in brighter
colors. A short skirt, a bodice laced up both front and
back, and above this a white body with sleeves, the neck
drawn in with a ruffle and tied with a bright ribbon.
White stockings and low shoes with a great buckle,
though some of the older people had these laid by as
mementoes of their younger days. The church was at
quite a distance and a priest came over and held service
in the morning for them in a little log house. I
used to love to watch them going to and fro with
prayer book and rosary and happy, smiling faces,
always chattering.
</p>

<p>
There were Germans, too. We seemed fair to be a
conglomerate town. All along the lake, houses were
stretching up north and down to the southern end.
The shipyard was a scene of activity; indeed, most
people were very busy. Wheat fields and cornfields
increased and cattle were multiplying. Everything
rushed through the summer; indeed, it seemed as
though one could see the corn grow; and was there
ever a prettier sight than when it tasselled out and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
blossomed in the soft yellow. It was like a great army.
I used to look at it sometimes until I could believe it
was a giant host advancing, and I would shrink back
in fright.
</p>

<p>
We had a school on our side that summer, and what
with that and Mrs. Chadwick, I did not go to the
Haynes' as often as before. Ben and Homer came
over frequently. Homer was a big fellow, almost as
tall as Dan, and quite a favorite with the girls as well.
There were many pleasure parties for the grown-up
ones—rowing, when the lake was not too rough, and
sailing parties. Some of the more venturesome ones
took an excursion over to Black Rock.
</p>

<p>
Our nearest French neighbors were the Piagets, and
the two girls, Sophie and Nanette, soon became very
friendly. Nanette was a little younger than I, Sophie,
nearly two years older, bright, vivacious girls, who
had some accomplishments beyond our ken. We
sewed patchwork, but it was difficult to get pieces,
though now and then a quilt was made of blue and
white. But Sophie could make fringe with an ingenious
knot in it, and she could knit edging. That set all
us girls crazy to learn.
</p>

<p>
They talked rather broken English and were very
eager to perfect themselves. And after screwing my
courage up many degrees I confessed I would like
to learn French. What work we made of it, and how
we laughed at the German tongue! You began to hear
it quite often in the street.
</p>

<p>
M'liss had taken up her abode with us. Jed Hatch
had gone lumbering up the lake, above where Milwaukee
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
now stands, where there was some fine timber
that could be rafted down in auspicious weather.
They had what we should now call a logging camp.
Father wondered how they had ever persuaded Jed to
join them, but I think M'liss had a strong hand in it.
So she brought little Joe, who was now quite a
respectable baby. Mrs. Chadwick had more than once
said to father some woman ought to come in and take
charge, and M'liss thought she made a good bargain
hiring out her house for a certain amount of repairs.
</p>

<p>
M'liss brought her big wheel, the little one I had
already, but when I would have spun she turned me
away with a gentle push and—
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you jest g'lang. Ther' be time er nough nex'
winter, when you can't run out en play en skip round.
En ther's so little work to do I'm main afeared I'll git
rickets by so much sittin' still."
</p>

<p>
Then M'liss was in her element cooking, and father
enjoyed that.
</p>

<p>
Sophie was very eager to see Chicago. They had
lived inland many miles from Kaskaskia, and as I came
to know afterward, had a hard struggle with poverty.
</p>

<p>
"I think everybody has come from somewhere else,"
she said one day, when I had been telling about the
Haynes, the Wrights, and ourselves.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," I said, "people don't grow in new
countries like trees. They have to come from somewhere
else," and she laughed.
</p>

<p>
It was true enough. When we arrived at a time
when we would have liked a Mayflower or a Holland
Mynheer, Virginia Cavaliers, or Spanish Dons, behold
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
we had no ancestry that had risen out of the foam or
been transplanted by fabled Deity. Only sturdy,
courageous, hard-working pioneers who had seen an
objective point and seized it and dreamed of being a
connecting link between the East and the West
and then worked mightily to make the dream come
true.
</p>

<p>
We rambled about the old places. The Ouilmette
cabin had fallen into ruins, but the memory of the
trader and his Indian wife still hung about it. We
went over to the fort, that began to show signs of
neglect. Here were the unmarked graves of those who
had perished and we trod softly. Grass and a few wild
flowers were springing up over them. Mrs. Heald and
her beautiful horse stirred Sophie as it had me.
</p>

<p>
"If you came out here and stayed until midnight,
don't you suppose you could see her go riding down
to escape the Indians?"
</p>

<p>
I shuddered. "I don't believe I should want to be
here at midnight," I said, rather awestricken.
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you try a charm to see your future husband?"
she queried.
</p>

<p>
"I don't imagine I shall ever have a husband," I
said, with a curious kind of assurance about the future.
I seemed to belong altogether to father.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wouldn't stay single for anything," she cried,
"and here, where you don't need to have a dot, it must
be easy to get a husband."
</p>

<p>
"A dot?" I repeated in perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes. In France, <i>Ma mère</i> had to have some
money beside a string of gold beads and two rings and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
some bed and table linen. Papa's mother would hardly
consent then. You have to get the permission of the
parents on both sides, and then you have two marriages."
</p>

<p>
"How queer! Why, it is almost like buying your
wife," I said, and I felt my eyes open wide.
</p>

<p>
"And now we are poor enough," and she sighed. "I
don't know whether Nanette and I could have any
dot. Then you generally go in a convent and become
a sister, but I shouldn't like to be shut up and only
visit poor people and those in trouble. There is a convent
in New Orleans and in Canada."
</p>

<p>
I did not think I should like convent life either. The
Piaget girls went to the Catholic Church in state, and
the priest was Father Shoffer. It was moved to the
rear of St. Mary's Cathedral afterward and used as a
school-room, but children of all denominations went to
school together. The Methodist Church had been
moved across the river two years before on scows, the
first building of any account to be moved intact.
Everybody had thronged to see the wonderful achievement.
</p>

<p>
We used to wander by the edge of the great lake,
often picking up shells in the sand. I had quite a collection,
some beautiful ones Norman had given me.
Homer had made me a box that I covered with them,
arranging the choicest ones on the top in a figure as
near to a rose as I could get it.
</p>

<p>
Ben used to walk with us sometimes. The magnificence
of the lake down here, where there was no business
and nothing but the swelling waves to ruffle its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
bosom, always filled me with a kind of reverent awe.
The great space ending—where? To my childish mind
it was like the ocean that I had never seen. I could
not truly believe there were villages and wide stretches
of ground on the other side. I liked its immensity.
Several times we had been here on a moonlight evening,
when it was silvered over and set with tiny gems.
All at the west and south stretched the dusky, blurring
expanse, but to the eastward one could imagine that
one could sail into the heaven that touched the farther
boundary of the great inland sea. That wonderful
angelic blue with its myriad stars! Were they worlds
in which the souls of the redeemed lived again? I
wanted to talk all my new thoughts over with Norman.
I seemed to have acquired so many in this brief
while.
</p>

<p>
There was another great excitement about this time.
Was it really four years since the last Presidential election?
The town was all astir again. The same candidates
were put up. Dan Hayne did a good deal of
electioneering, though it was not in such a very eager
manner. I believe most of the people felt very sore
about the canal that was to open the Mississippi to us,
which dragged along to little purpose. Then the postal
regulations were so inefficient, and there was a
complaint about many things, confusing State and
general government. The Kentucky people were all
for General Jackson, and some of the old men declared
they'd vote for him as long as they lived whether he
was alive or not. The two papers indulged in sharp
rejoinders, and occasionally stretched the point of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
truth, at least each accused the other of doing it.
Father pinned his faith upon the American.
</p>

<p>
People were very busy, too, with the abundant harvests.
Such splendid yield of wheat as there had
been! And to think of all this labor done by hand!
One would have been smartly ridiculed if he had predicted
the day of mowers and reapers and great grain
elevators run by steam. Many a moonlight night men
turned out and worked until they almost dropped, some
did stop in their tracks and take a brief nap on a
fragrant bed, with the stars for watchers. For the
winter was coming, when Nature took her rest and
locked our little world with her icy chains.
</p>

<p>
There was beef and pork packed to send away,
piles of hides, bushels of grain, and the prominent business
men left politics to care for itself awhile. The river
and the docks were thronged and piled high, we
thought then. Ben was much interested in this, and
now had gone in Norman's place, though Mr. Hubbard's
business was growing larger every year, and
new warehouses were pushing in.
</p>

<p>
But we children went to school, and at home followed
the useful arts—spinning, sewing, knitting and
cooking. We had little time for the fripperies of life.
They were to come later.
</p>

<p>
I did not forget my reading with Mrs. Chadwick,
though I was growing very fond of the girls and girls'
play. Jed Hatch had not come back, so M'liss remained
with us. There was a great stir about the
copper mines in northern Michigan, and the lead at
Galena. Then coal was being discovered here and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
there, and men's wits were put to work in inventing
labor-saving and money-saving machines.
</p>

<p>
We did not care much about these, though the
neighbors who stopped at the garden gate or sat
awhile on the stoop talking to father wondered a little
if this or that could not be done, and sometimes laughed
at father when he predicted great things for the future
of Chicago. We did not look much like it in those
days, though people were beginning to build brick
houses and replace their old log structures with frame.
Many of the streets were simply staked out. And
when the Wrights built their really pretty mansion
down near what was the end of Madison Street, they
were laughed at as going out on the prairie.
</p>

<p>
Good water seemed a serious question. There were
so few springs good for anything. We caught rain
water in the wet season and filtered it, putting it in
bottles for time of need, when after a good shaking up
it answered very well. The water from the lake was
fine if taken from a little distance out or farther up.
The river was simply dreadful.
</p>

<p>
One of the best springs had an odd story. The
children used often to congregate about it and drink
their fill. I used to wonder if it tasted as good to the
stag at Monan's rill as to the thirsty children. It was
called Colonel Baubein's punch bowl. Half a dozen
years or so before, the State ordered that the militia
of Cook County should be duly organized, and officers
elected. There was quite a rivalry, but Mr. John Baubein
was elected over all opposition, and it was resolved
to have a fine celebration. At the base of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
small bluff the spring made a natural basin. This was
dammed up across the outlet and a keg of brandy
poured in. Six dozen lemons, four packages of loaf
sugar were added, and the whole stirred with a new
clean stick. Most of the town turned out, and sitting
around swapped stories and drank punch until they
absolutely lowered the novel punch bowl and went
home in a high state of hilarity. For days after one
and another stole down, happy even in getting a taste
of the weaker stimulant.
</p>

<p>
It was delightful water long after that, and the
two Baubein brothers were famous men in old
Chicago.
</p>

<p>
Champaign squibs and songs had a new impulse just
then. Even the children who could made rhymes to
the glory of Tippecanoe. And then there was a sudden
and well-nigh unexpected rejoicing—William
Henry Harrison gained the day by a handsome
majority.
</p>

<p>
Father was deeply delighted, though he did not exactly
crow over his opponents.
</p>

<p>
"You'll see now," he said, "this will be the beginning
of good times. Four years from now you will
hardly know yourselves." No one could have imagined
then his reign would be so brief.
</p>

<p>
"If there could be more money, more money," cried
everybody. The canal was given up for better times,
but the lake was left. And when one looked over the
list of enterprising citizens and found the hides and
wheat, the corn and pork and beef, the beans, salt,
the furs, and the lead, there was no need of feeling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
really discouraged. "Rome wasn't built in a day,"
was a favorite saying of father's.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hayne and I had good long letters from Norman.
Mine were written at intervals and finished at
Detroit, that, like some of the other towns, had a
rather romantic history. It had been French and English,
it had been a great trading place in the pioneer
days; it had been turned over to the United States by
treaty, then given up to the English by General Hull
at the same time the order had been sent for the evacuation
of Fort Dearborn. It had been destroyed by fire
and rebuilt on a more generous plan, and bid fair to be
a fine city.
</p>

<p>
But with all these interesting matters Norman's
heart did not waver, and he was looking steadily forward.
One year was almost gone. He had been very
busy and happy, had proved of great service to Mr.
Le Moyne, and had acquired much knowledge. He
could talk French quite well, and was learning to read
correctly. It seemed as if most of the northern world
was French. Now they were to go to Montreal and
Quebec. Would I find some histories or books and
read up about those famous cities and the heroes who
had fought and died for them? And would I tell him
all about myself? Was I growing tall? And did my
hair keep its beautiful light tint, and he hoped I would
care for my complexion. He had seen some such
beautiful girls, some splendid Indian maidens, so lovely
he did not wonder white men married them. Did Ben
come often, and did I like him very much? But I
must not put any one in his place.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He could write ever so much more—and there were
pages and pages in the letter, but there were so many
things to do, and this letter would go by private hands,
with some other matters consigned to Newberry &amp;
Dole. For postage was very high and increased with
additional miles.
</p>

<p>
I read it to father, and he was very much pleased,
but he made one little growl. There are some voices
that express disapprobation that way, and it is really
more amusing than unkind.
</p>

<p>
"Like Ben Hayne! Why, he's nothing but a big,
soft-headed boy. Homer's smarter in his little finger
than Ben's whole body."
</p>

<p>
"Ben is very nice and kind," I said honestly, "but
Norman is the best of all."
</p>

<p>
He gave a chuckle at that. "You mark my words,
Homer will be a rich man some day. I don't know
about the rolling stones, though it did seem an excellent
thing for Norman. But he will never come back
here and settle in Chicago."
</p>

<p>
Long afterward that sentence recurred to me.
</p>

<p>
I took my letter over to Mrs. Hayne. Hers
was a good deal on the same lines, only there were
more to ask about. She made a different comment.
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't you like Ben!" she exclaimed,
rather tartly. Then as she looked at me I felt hot all
over. "Ben's a nice boy an' he'll make a nice man if
he gets the right kind of wife. He will do quite as
well as Norman, you'll see if he doesn't. I dare say
Norme will get so stuck up with fine people an' talkin'
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
French that he'll hardly look at us when he gets back.
I'm most sorry I consented to have him go."
</p>

<p>
"But he will be back in another year." I did not
think he could change so very much in that time.
</p>

<p>
"Mebbe so, mebbe so," and she tossed her head.
</p>

<p>
There was not another girl in school who had a
letter from a friend or who was asked to write one.
My secret was too precious to be bruited abroad. I
put it in my box of treasures and read it over when
no one was by. It seemed very silly to do this, and yet
I took fervent pleasure in it.
</p>

<p>
I was to write and have my letter go in a package
Mr. Dole was to send. So when I had it finished I
went over to the warehouse, for I would not trust it
with Ben. I had some trouble to find Mr. Dole, and
explained the matter to him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," he said, "I shall be glad to do this for
you. I think he will be in Quebec before it reaches
him, however."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," I replied, with a little curtsy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER IX
<br />
WAS EVER LETTER HALF SO DEAR?
</h2>

<p>
How eagerly we devoured the paper when the new
President was inaugurated. The Whig party had a
ball at the Tremont Hotel, and the young ladies who
went held their heads very high for weeks. Polly Morrison
and Peggy Garnier were the two belles. Miss
Garnier was among the immigrants from the border
of Kentucky. Her father had taken a great interest in
cattle raising and packing. There were two smaller
girls and a son, who certainly was a spoiled darling,
even in those days. Margaret Garnier was tall and
really handsome. Sixteen was grown up at that
period. She had large, beautiful black eyes, and
a great coil of black hair which, those who knew,
said came down to her knees. A brunette complexion,
not very dark, and color in her cheeks like an opening
rose; by all odds, the handsomest girl in the room, it
was said.
</p>

<p>
But Polly Morrison pressed her hard. She was tall
and slim and with the litheness of figure that made
every movement fascinating. And as for her dancing,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
every man was crazy to dance with her, and when he
had danced once he was bewitched and bound to dance
again. She must have had some charm in spite of her
red hair and her peculiar eyes. Her skin was very
white and she rarely flushed all over her face, even
when she had been dancing at her wildest.
</p>

<p>
Some of the girls in school had sisters or brothers
who were present. Many of the married people went
as well. I sat at home and studied my lessons, then
knit some rounds on a pair of white wool stockings for
myself, while M'liss told of some dances she had been
to out at the old fort.
</p>

<p>
"An' how I could come to be sech an idjit as to
marry Jed Hatch I can't fer the life of me 'xplain
now, 'cept what is to be will be ef it doesn't come to
pass in years, en ef 'tis writ down agin yer, yer can't
'scape it. An' now he's up yander 'n I'm jest as good
as a d'serted wife, airnin' my own livin'."
</p>

<p>
I couldn't altogether fancy M'liss dressed up in an
airy costume dancing. I had always thought her
rather heavy footed.
</p>

<p>
Dan Hayne was one of the stars of the evening as
well, and no one could have mistrusted as he and Peggy
whirled round, and I sat between the chimney and the
light stand knitting, that we three were marked out for
a tragedy. Was it true what M'liss had said—"That
what is to be will be?"
</p>

<p>
The girls discussed it eagerly at recess. Jenny
Hale's sister Betty was at the ball and had spiced the
breakfast with it.
</p>

<p>
"'Pears like them two girls were jest neck and neck
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
for Dan Hayne, Bet said, 'n he was the han'somest feller
in the room. An' Bet danced once with him 'n she
didn't see that he was so much eleganter than Tee
Kent, 'n she was glad she had a feller of her own. Bet's
goin' to be married when Tee's house is done—long in
May that'll be—en ther'll be some dancin' then, an' I'll
have a sheer, you'll see!"
</p>

<p>
"You need a little grammar more than you do
dancing," declared Martha Dole. "You talk as if you
had just come out of the backwoods."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you think you're great, Mat Dole! You're
mighty stuck up on a little."
</p>

<p>
"Girls, don't quarrel," said a soft voice, "and it does
seem as if we might pay a little attention to teacher.
You know she wrote out a lot of words the other day
that she asked us to be careful about. Some of us do
talk outlandish."
</p>

<p>
"I'll talk as I like. I'm way ahead of you in figurin',
an' I don't care a pin fer grammar. 'Twont help you
keep house, 'n I'm goin' to be married first chance
I have. I ain't hankerin' fer school teachin' and
sech."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of rigs did they have on?" asked another
girl. "My mother's got a satiny frock all lace and
white ribbons that she was married in, and in a year or
two I'll grow in it. You'll see me dancing when the
next President goes in."
</p>

<p>
The bell rang and we filed back into school. M'liss
heard about the ball, and it was dished up at supper.
</p>

<p>
"The men had a big dinner which was quite as sensible,"
said father, "except the whiskey, and if they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
hadn't all been of one stripe they'd quarrelled. Strange
men don't know enough not to get drunk!"
</p>

<p>
Dan Hayne was getting to be one of the young men
of note—born lucky, people said. He was dickering
in a good many things, and whatever he took hold of
turned out well. He traded one of his horses for
some wharf property and a few weeks afterward sold
that at an advance, and so with most things. Chita,
his beautiful mare, was the apple of his eye and always
won in a race. If there was a purse she captured it.
</p>

<p>
A week afterward he had Miss Garnier out sleighing,
for the snow was not all gone. The handsomest
couple in Chicago, the men said, and the women predicted
it would be a match.
</p>

<p>
Alas, in the midst of gayeties a great sorrow fell
over the nation. The hero of the Indian wars, who had
borne his former defeat with dignity, and his elevation
to the highest office the nation could bestow, was suddenly
called away from earthly honors. The nation
mourned him sincerely. Mr. Tyler, the Vice-President,
succeeded him, according to the Constitution.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the whole country emerged from a period
of prostration. Chicago, certainly did, and this time
not to fall back into languor. The hogs were finally
banished from the street. There had long been an
estray pen, but it had proved no terror to evil doers.
There was an attempt to make the streets passable, and
the water question again came to the fore. There were
some artesian wells, and some good water quite on the
outskirts of the town. Court House Square was filled
up somewhat, and the questions of raising the grade of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
the streets was discussed, of a water supply, of deepening
the bed of the river at its outlet and removing the
sand bar, of new wharfs and docks to accommodate
business. The papers were full of plans and schemes,
and the completion of the canal was again strenuously
advocated.
</p>

<p>
Father was a good deal interested in all these matters.
I used to sit and listen to the talk and imagine
what the town would be sometime, but no dream ever
approached the marvellous reality. Occasionally Dan
would stop. He and father were interested in corn and
cattle. He had developed into a handsome fellow, but
all the Haynes were good looking.
</p>

<p>
Quite in the summer word came to M'liss that her
husband was dead up in Michigan. As he had never
done much toward taking care of her, even child as I
was, he did not seem much loss, but she took it very
hard, and straightway endowed him with numerous
virtues, and bewailed him in tones of anguish that
really alarmed me.
</p>

<p>
"O, M'liss," exclaimed father, "do use a little reason
and sense. You took more than half the care of him
when he was home, and now for over a year you have
not had a penny from him. You can support yourself
and your child just as well without him as with him.
And if you are hankering for another husband, I'll
hunt up two or three likely men and give you your
pick."
</p>

<p>
"It's all very well fer you to talk, Mr. Gaynor, but
you only had a little gal to bring up, an' she's been the
kind that doesn't jump over bars an' get outen the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
pasture. But boys is diffrunt an' mighty high headed.
En I'm thinkin' what I'll do whenst he grows up an'
needs a strong hand—a man's hand. Poor fatherless
lamb!"
</p>

<p>
"He seems a pretty good kind now," and father gave,
a dry smile. "Between you and me, M'liss, I guess
we can manage to bring him up and have him trot in
single harness. You can have a good home here as
long as you like, so I wouldn't worry."
</p>

<p>
"But I've never lost a husband before, an' to have
him snatched outen your hand without a momen's
warnin', as one may say, is very tryin' to nerves. An'
no funeral to speak of. Mebbe not a hymn sung over
him. Everybody's sorrows is deepest."
</p>

<p>
Father took his hat and went out. M'liss caught up
little Joe, who kicked and scrambled to be let down on
the floor again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you poor lamb, you don't know what you've
lost. You can never have a nuther father. Fer if I
should marry again, which the Lord forbid, he'd only
be a stepfather an' like as not be ugly to you."
</p>

<p>
Little Joe gave an expansive smile, showing his
eight small white teeth, and pounded his mother's knee
with his fist.
</p>

<p>
"I'll clear the table," I said, thinking to leave her to
enjoy her sorrow.
</p>

<p>
"No, you needn't. I won't defraud any one, even if
I am bowed down with grief. I've got to airn my
livin' an' my child's livin', fer ther's no one to depend
on now, an' I've heard say he who goes sorrowin' fills
the pools with water, er somethin' like that. No, I'll
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
wash up. But I'd feel a heap better ef there'd been a
funeral en a farewell to the remains. An' that ther'
great big cimitery with hardly a livin' soul in it, where
he'd be doubly welcome, I know."
</p>

<p>
She went at the dishes, and presently began to sing,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Why should we mourn departed friends,</p>
<p class="i1">Or shake at death's alarms?"</p>
</div></div>

<p>
That seemed to be her favorite for days, but I wondered
she did not comfort herself with the remaining
half of the verse.
</p>

<p>
I think father felt altogether resigned to the affliction
of Providence. M'liss was a good cook and kept the
house tidy. Sometimes he thought I wasn't learning
enough to fit me to manage a house, but there were so
many other interests. I was working away with spirit
at the French. I knew a good many words, and when
Madame Piaget found that I really wanted to learn,
she gave me assistance more to the point than Sophie's
desultory training.
</p>

<p>
It was a delightful, merry summer. Sophie knew
some games and curious stories and was always ready
for a walk, and whether I had not noted it before or
whether civilization had induced it to compensate for
the barrenness, there were new wild flowers springing
up here and there, and how magnificent the prairies
were in their long reaches over to the western world,
to the infinite golden distances and the glittering splendors
of the sunset. Then when the long spires of crimson
faded into lavender and pale pink and blue,
then soft grays and darkness settled about the edges,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
coming nearer and nearer, like some weird army with
a soundless step until one fairly shivered with a weird
terror, and one's soul was entranced.
</p>

<p>
Crops were excellent. It seemed as if everything
was prosperous and people were full of stir and spirit
and hope. We girls used to go in town, as we called it.
There were some stores with very pretty goods,
and the two quite pretentious drug stores with red and
blue jars. I told Sophie about Rosamond, and we
wondered how any one could be so silly as to make a
sacrifice for a purple jar.
</p>

<p>
"I just wish I could find some little girls willing
to buy them. Mother makes such beautiful dyes," declared
Sophie.
</p>

<p>
Madame Piaget, later on, made quite a little money
by dyeing goods.
</p>

<p>
Of all the places, I liked the bookstore best. There
were various articles besides books. Cigars, tobacco,
papers from Black Rock, rather from the cities of the
east. No matter if the news was a month old if we
had not heard it before. Father was very fond of
reading about the advances Boston was making.
</p>

<p>
"I wish we had a greater grasp of intelligence," he
would say. Then with a sigh—"But one must have
food and shelter first, and a town like this is going to
cost a mint of money before we get through. Why,
they're talking of raising the whole thing, so the river
and the lake will not overflow. Pity it's so low, and no
mountains about us to cast into the sea," with a
chuckle. "If we had had faith to move 'em, we might
transport some from Virginia or Tennessee, or we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
might find some nearer home, up Michigan way, or
farther west. But I'm afraid we haven't the faith, so
we must go at the work with good courage."
</p>

<p>
The Chicago River was not very wide then, but it
had a considerable depth. It seemed as if the earth
had been split open at some time just as a mighty
plough had turned a furrow. It had no current to
speak of and was a source of great discomfort.
</p>

<p>
It was true Chicago did not begin intellectually.
There was too much work to do, and all honor to those
who evolved a great city out of a trading station after
years of work.
</p>

<p>
But we did take note of what was going on outside.
Dickens was attracting attention, and Mr. Harris and
his sister were quite enthusiastic about him until he
had visited America and written the "Notes," showing
up a certain uncouthness and sharpness in national
character that was very displeasing. As if England
had reached her full glory in a few years instead of
centuries. I liked Sir Walter Scott best, though
Thackeray was much talked of. I was fond of the
illustrations—how crude we thought them twenty
years afterward! There was a Mr. Cooper writing
Indian stories and novels of the earlier history of the
country, but Boston was considered a kind of head
centre. And though there were such stirring episodes
all up and down the Mississippi River, the Gulf of
Mexico and the islands below that, no one thought of
putting them in print. Madame Piaget knew many
stories about John Lafitte, who had once been such a
terror and defied the authorities on his curious unconquerable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
island. But I liked to hear how he came and
offered his services to General Jackson when New Orleans
was in danger by the British; and I used to
wonder about the old wonderful Spanish French town,
with its balconies overhung with roses that bloomed
all the year round, and the beautiful women sitting on
them and looking down at the passers-by, the streets
full of bright merriment and music.
</p>

<p>
Chicago had begun to consider a regular water
supply. The water carts had been the main dependence.
Now at Lake Street and Michigan Avenue
plans were laid for a great reservoir. An iron pipe
was to run out in the lake about a hundred and fifty
feet to clear water. There was to be a big pump,
worked by steam engines of twenty-five horsepower.
Large logs were bored for the water to run through.
We all thought it wonderful then, and throngs of people
crowded around on Sunday to view the progress,
making various amusing comments. Ten years later
the work was renewed on what was considered a magnificent
scale, and even this was presently outgrown.
</p>

<p>
I was happy and busy through those years and making
friends with the girls, the boys as well. We all
played together, rambled around, went to each other's
houses and spent evenings in guessing riddles, telling
stories and reciting incidents or poems. The girls
joined in ball playing and running races. Polly Morrison
distanced all competitors, even the boys. I used
to like to see her. She never "wriggled," nor threw
out her arms like sails, but seemed to cut the air in a
straight line. It was like the flying of a bird.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was no end of guesses that summer, I think
bets as well, as to which of the girls would capture
Dan Hayne. Miss Garnier held her head very high.
Peggy was daring and lawless. She had no end of
admirers and the young fellows almost fought for her.
But she had some art to keep them from coming to
blows. They always had a good time where she was,
and a dull time without her.
</p>

<p>
I had two staunch friends that I dealt around to the
girls I liked the best—Homer and Ben Hayne. I was
too young to think of lovers. They were both very
good to me. Homer was doing finely and his father
was proud of him. Building was no high art in those
days, but Homer possessed a certain attractive ingenuity.
He could make a closet that had an ornamental
air. He could put up a shelf and tack a bit of moulding
on it and it set off the corner or the vacant space.
He made an ingenious chair held by strong oak pins,
that you could let down and transform into a bed. He
designed such dainty mouldings with his array of
beading planes. His charm was that he finished everything
so exquisitely.
</p>

<p>
He had his heart set on making money. He meant
to be "well to do." What a small sum then seemed to
be a fortune. Father liked him very much and often
advised him.
</p>

<p>
Ben had less originality and aim. On the booky
side we agreed very well, but he had not the breadth
nor quickness of Norman. When I bade him pause at
some delightful thought that one wanted to linger over
he would glance up with a smile of unreasoning obedience.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
Everything I did and said was just right. He
was a nice, steady, business fellow, but Mr. Harris admitted
that Norman was worth two of him.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hayne was always sweet and motherly to me,
but she was growing stouter and less energetic, though
she kept her passion for cooking.
</p>

<p>
"If I had you down to the hotel!" Clement Ward
used to say. "Though I d'now, you cook so all fired
tasty an' temptin' that I might be et out of house an'
home afore I knew jest what was the matter. There's
no one in fifty mile that can give jest the flavoracity to
victuals that you do. When I've et a meal here the
taste stays in my mouth fer days. An sech pie crust!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've been cooking for men and boys all my
life, afore I was married and since. An' Dan an' his
father are powerful eaters. So 'twould be a poor story
if I couldn't hit it jest right."
</p>

<p>
There was always plenty to cook, meat and game
and several fine kinds of fish.
</p>

<p>
Then the day when the mail steamer came in was
beginning to be one of expectation. I did not care for
the ones that came down the lake, though they often
brought valuable mail, but this came from the East.
I had looked for a letter such a long while, it seemed
to me, and early as I was the long line appalled me.
</p>

<p>
"You're John Gaynor's little girl!" said a friendly
voice as I was peering about. "Come here, I'll make
a little room, and he thrust out his arm, drawing me
into the line just before him. "Father got any folks
in York State?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but a letter may come from Canada."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Whew!" he ejaculated. "Let me see—G— isn't
it?"
</p>

<p>
They were sorting letters in the small room, and laying
the piles on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Denby," said my friend, "and John Gaynor."
</p>

<p>
"Here's a Gaynor, but it's a woman. Oh, yes, care
of John, twenty cents postage."
</p>

<p>
You could not always pay postage through and no
one made it a matter of compliment in those days. I
had a quarter and some pennies beside.
</p>

<p>
"Here, I'll make change," he said, and I thanked
him most sincerely. He smiled and nodded as I
stepped out of the line and ran swiftly home. Norman
had said the next letter would be all to myself.
</p>

<p>
It went in the great fire with hundreds of other
choice treasures, but oh, what a delight it was to me!
I had looked at the flag token in the morning, so I
had not gone to school. Joe was playing about the
door step, emulating the old monarch by eating grass.
M'liss was washing out under the apple-tree, so I
slipped into the room and threw my sunbonnet on the
floor.
</p>

<p>
There were no envelopes, no dainty sheets of paper.
This was "foolscap," written on three sides, and little
spaces rescued on the fourth. Ah! what a delight it
was. So much about the historic old city, the French
residents, the English officers, the government and
business, the picturesque houses with their pathetic
stories. Norman could talk French almost like a
native. And the business! Chicago would be amazed
at the volume of it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was a great deal about Mr. Le Moyne, his
kindly care, "almost as if I was a son," was the eager
confession. The journeys they were taking about, the
friends Mr. Le Moyne met, the charming and cultivated
women, who played the piano and sang in the most
delightful manner. It was like living in a story book.
And he had to go everywhere, to do almost everything
for Mr. Le Moyne, whose eyesight was poorer than
ever. Presently when the business was all finished
they would go to New York. And then he hoped to
be able to come home. It seemed almost a lifetime
to him.
</p>

<p>
"You are such a dear, sweet letter writer," he said.
"The boys only send messages by mother, and she
hasn't the fashion of telling me all the little things
about them that you do. You picture everything so that
I can see it. Mr. Harris writes about business and
books, and what the <i>American</i> and what the <i>Democrat</i>
says, and the squabbles of the city government. But
I like to go down to the very heart of things, to know
when you have a new frock, and the little companies
you attended, and the plays and the walks, and the
new wild flowers you have found. Is there any place
like the boyhood home, any other little girl like you?
Not if I should search the world over.
</p>

<p>
"I have been reading some wonderful plays by
Shakespeare. Mr. Harris has a copy, I know. Ask
him to let you see 'Midsummer Night's Dream.' We
went to a theatre here in Quebec and saw it played.
I can't tell why, but I thought of you all the time. 'If
she were here, if she were here,' I kept saying to every
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
turn. It was enchanting. I cannot do it any justice in
a letter, and I have written so much already. Oh, why
can't people talk through space? I sometimes send
messages on the wind—do you get them, dear? Send
me back some. And—can you believe at Christmas
or thereabout I shall see you? I measure six feet now,
and sometimes I think I begin to look like Dan, only
I shall never be as handsome. Tell me all about his
girls. It's high time he was married."
</p>

<p>
It was written very closely, and oh, what a delight
it was! I sat there all of a tremble hugging it to my
heart. Joe was hammering on the steps with the new
potato masher that Homer had made, and I never heard
him. M'liss came in wringing her hands as if she was
squeezing the suds out of them.
</p>

<p>
"Fer the land sakes! Haven't you done a bit about
dinner? I see you come in, an' sez I, 'She'll peel the
'taters sure,' an' here you're sittin' calm as if dinners
come to hand already cooked. Ye might as well bin
in school, then I'd a-knowed jest what to do."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," I said penitently. "But I had such a
splendid long letter from Norman." Then I jumped
up and there was a sound like a pistol. A continual
dripping will wear away a stone saith the adage—the
steady pounding on the stone had split my masher.
</p>

<p>
"Drat that young un!" M'liss gave him two or three
slaps, and the roar of little Joe was terrific.
</p>

<p>
"Oh don't!" I cried, and went to comfort him.
</p>

<p>
"You'll jes' spile that fatherless child, who'll need a
man to govern him 'fore long, he's that deestructive.
You goin' to peel the 'taters or me?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I smiled at the question, but went for the potatoes,
and soon had them over the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Ther's beans to heat up, an' that ther huckleberry
puddin' to steam over. People can't have much to do
whenst they write letters so long it takes a whole
mornin' to read 'em. I've got the clothes to hang up."
</p>

<p>
Joe had rolled over on the grass and was trying to
catch "hoppers," laughing at the way they eluded him.
I set the table, brought out the boiled ham and sliced
it, and when father came in everything was ready.
</p>

<p>
He was intensely interested in the letter.
</p>

<p>
"I do wonder how Chicago will look to him after
all the fine cities he's seen. I sometimes think I was
a fool to come out here. Then when I see the wheat
standing so thick with great golden heads, and the corn
rushing along like a regiment, and the pigs fattening,
and the hens laying eggs, I say it's about as good a
country as the Lord has made anywhere. Only if he'd
raised the ground a little higher just around 'twould a
been more to my liking, and there are plenty of
mountains that could have spared a slice off of
them."
</p>

<p>
I went over to the Haynes' in the afternoon. Mother
Haynes's letter had come too. She was beginning to
have trouble with her eyesight, and her spectacles didn't
seem to fit rightly. So she was glad to have me read
it aloud to her. Mr. Le Moyne had raised Norman's
salary, and said he would never be able to spare him.
And Norman was very happy, only he did want to see
all the home folks. Did father keep well, and was
little Chris growing? Why didn't some of the boys
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
write to him? With all the pleasure and the business
it was hard to be away from everybody.
</p>

<p>
"Harder for him than for us," and the mother sighed.
</p>

<p>
I read her my letter except some paragraphs that
had a kind of sacred feeling to me, though there was
nothing very secret in them.
</p>

<p>
And if we could see him by Christmas!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER X
<br />
A WILD RIDE
</h2>

<p>
It was truly a gay summer for the grown-ups. There
were rowing parties on the lake, and picnics came
quite in vogue. Dan Hayne was doing a little of
everything, buying and selling lots, interested in lead,
in cattle, taking short journeys here and there to view
coming prospects. Withal he found time for girls,
went to dances, drove them out, and just when
some one thought him caught, he was off with the old
fancy.
</p>

<p>
Miss Garnier seemed to like him very much, or was
it the spirit of coquetry? For in August a young Kentuckian
of one of the first families suddenly appeared
on the scene, and then it was said they had been lovers
and quarrelled, and now made up again. A date was
set for a speedy marriage in St. James' Church, to the
great surprise of everybody.
</p>

<p>
How would Dan Hayne take it?
</p>

<p>
He took it with a jaunty indifference, and not only
went to the wedding, but led the procession that saw the
bride start on her journey to her new home.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"She was an awful flirt," declared Polly Morrison,
"but I knew he didn't mean to marry her."
</p>

<p>
Even Polly held her head quite high in those days,
and seemed to take pleasure in parading her numerous
admirers.
</p>

<p>
The school girls were playing under a group of cottonwood
trees one afternoon, when Polly and two or
three of the older ones paused and joined the merriment.
Sophie Piaget was telling charms. They
should have gone out on St. John's night and walked
three times around the church. On the way home you
would hear a name called, and that would be the
name of your future husband. Then you counted nine
stars nine nights in succession, and you were sure to
marry the first man you shook hands with.
</p>

<p>
"But what if you didn't like him, or if he was married,"
suggested some one.
</p>

<p>
"Then you mustn't shake hands with him," laughed
Polly. "Save your shake for some one you do like."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let's go out and get Shubenca to tell our fortunes."
</p>

<p>
They all rose in eagerness. Shubenca was an old
Indian woman who did predict remarkable events, and
they sometimes came true.
</p>

<p>
It was not far to the tepee, though two or three girls
suggested it might be better to go home and help get
supper.
</p>

<p>
"Will you have <i>your</i> fortune told?" Several of the
girls were hanging on Polly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, first of all, I've a silver shilling to cross her
hand, so it's sure to come true."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear, but will we have to pay?" exclaimed a
chorus in vexation of spirit.
</p>

<p>
"I'll make her tell a lot for the shilling." Polly was
in high spirits and a generous mood.
</p>

<p>
We found Shubenca sitting by the side of the tepee,
thumbing a pack of cards. She gave a careless nod
and went on. Polly stated the purport of the visit
and displayed the shilling. The black eyes snapped
with desire.
</p>

<p>
"How many?" in her guttural tone.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see—Sophy and you, Letty, and Caroline—well,
say six."
</p>

<p>
The woman shook her head. "Too little, too little,"
she said with a frown.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well. I can tell the fortunes myself for
nothing," and Polly turned with a toss of the head.
</p>

<p>
The woman caught her skirt.
</p>

<p>
"Three," she said—"three," in an eager voice.
</p>

<p>
"No, six," in a decisive tone.
</p>

<p>
"Too much for the money."
</p>

<p>
Polly threw it from hand to hand, catching it in a
tempting manner.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," with a reluctant grunt. "You first?"
giving her a piercing glance.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, so the others can take courage."
</p>

<p>
She looked at her hand and nodded curiously.
</p>

<p>
"You get your heart's desire after a long while," she
said in her broken English. "You want it very much,
but you go past it and then sorrow. A fair girl picks
up what you have thrown away, and you hate her."
How the eyes gleamed! It made me shudder.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I had gone past the old woman to where a younger
one sat doing some bead work. Little ones played
about in their noiseless fashion. I caught sentences at
intervals. She would have two husbands and journeys,
go away and come back, and meet the man she loved
and be happy with him. "He throw away the fair
one for you—she too pale, too thin, she not love
enough."
</p>

<p>
"Well, so that I get him at last."
</p>

<p>
"You be wild for very joy."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is good. That is what I like."
</p>

<p>
Sophie Piaget came next. A husband of course.
First she thinks she cannot have him, for he love
another, then "it is not love, no, no!" shaking her
head.
</p>

<p>
Some one came galloping over the stubble, and we
all knew the horse and rider. He reined up suddenly.
Polly nodded indifferently.
</p>

<p>
"You promised me a ride on Chita," began Nannie
Piaget, patting the beautiful creature, who tossed her
head gayly.
</p>

<p>
"Did I? Well, now is a good time. Can you jump
up? And you won't squeal for fright? If you do
I shall let you drop."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, are you in earnest?" in a delighted tone.
</p>

<p>
"To be sure. Now—step on my foot and spring."
</p>

<p>
That was successfully achieved. He settled her in
front of him, put one arm around her, and off they
sped. What a beautiful sight she was, and her rider
sat her proudly. They appeared smaller and smaller as
we watched them. I had lost interest in the fortune
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
telling. Then the moving speck grew larger, and they
came in sight again until Chita trotted up to the throng
with what seemed a laugh in her eye.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's splendid! It's like going on the wings
of the wind."
</p>

<p>
Surely it was. I had watched them until it stirred
every pulse within me. Chita seemed human in her
enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
Old Shubenca's inspiration seemed to give out,
though she eyed Polly suspiciously. The last two
fortunes might have pleased little girls. They were
of new frocks and surprises, and a great pleasure coming
this way, and some one who cared for you, listened
to with girlish giggles.
</p>

<p>
Dan set down Letty Dole, who was profuse in her
expressions of delight. I don't know whether I looked
wistful. I wanted to hug Chita and she turned and
put her nose in my hand. What mystery was there in
her eyes?
</p>

<p>
"We must all go home," began Polly, peremptorily,
turning the girls in a kind of squad.
</p>

<p>
"Here's one who has not ridden Chita, nor any other
creature, I think—this little Gaynor girl."
</p>

<p>
"It's too late, Dan. And then she's such a timid
little thing. No, let her alone."
</p>

<p>
"It's time she had some courage put in her then,"
and he laughed gayly.
</p>

<p>
I was not a coward. I often ran over the wretched
bridges when the logs tilted so that you were in danger
of falling in. And I really was not afraid of ghosts
nor cows, not even mice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No, no. Let her alone. Come, children. Come,
Ruth."
</p>

<p>
Dan Hayne was fond of having his own way, and
crossing other people's wills. There was an imperious
note in Polly's tone. How it happened in an instant no
one perhaps could have told. I turned, Chita backed
a step or two, and then a strong arm caught me just
above the waist line, and I was whirled up on Chita's
back in front of Dan.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't, don't!" I cried.
</p>

<p>
"Dan, put her down!" commanded Polly.
</p>

<p>
The only reply was a gay laugh as we bounded away.
Dan slackened a moment and settled me, holding one
arm tight about me, and then we went on that loping
gait that seems like the motion of long swells. It
almost took my breath away.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set in vague levels of dun, purple clouds,
now making a gradual darkening of the atmosphere,
though it did not betoken any coming storm. All
about was softened, not like a fog, but a tenuous veil.
The stubble stretched out like a sea, and seemed to
light the path, but presently we came to the coarse
prairie grass, at which Chita gave a snort of disdain.
On and on we flew. It was unlike anything in my narrow
experience. I had no thought, no care, no fear,
it was exhilarating, fascinating. Were we riding into
the night and the unknown? For the pale yellow
edges of the level bars had vanished, it was all smooth
darkness over to the westward. And then a narrow
golden crescent hung out in the sky. All the eastward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
was growing bluer with the suggestion of infinite
space.
</p>

<p>
It was afterward, many a time, that I recalled this
wild ride, the weird loneliness, the penetrating silence
in which one feels what bated breath means.
</p>

<p>
"So, girlie, so," said a soft voice that recalled Norman,
and Chita slackened her pace, came to a standstill.
</p>

<p>
"Are you afraid?" He almost pressed the breath
out of me.
</p>

<p>
There was a cry of some wild animal. It seemed
to smite the night like blows, growing fainter at the
end, but I shivered.
</p>

<p>
Dan drew me up closer. I could feel his heart beat
against my back.
</p>

<p>
"No, I am not afraid." Somehow I was not with
him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you <i>are</i> plucky," with an oath. "And you
don't even want to scream?"
</p>

<p>
"Why—no," yet I was confused and bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose I dropped you down here and rode off?"
</p>

<p>
"But you wouldn't," I returned confidently.
</p>

<p>
He gave me still a tighter squeeze. "No, I
might murder the man I hated in hot blood, but I
couldn't be cruel to a kitten if it was entrusted to my
care."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dan, you could do a worse thing than leave
me there on the lonely prairie to perish. But I like to
think that you did not dream of it then."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Chita, take it easy. This little girl isn't any
more afraid of the dark than you."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Chita gave an answering whinny. We turned
toward the east, where the stars were faintly stealing
through the space that seemed tintless at first and then
grew bluer. How curiously timid they seemed, how
they blossomed out in amber and opal and chrysoprase.
Afterward I came to know their names, their path to
the summit of glory and their decline, to wander for
years, perhaps, and then reign again in new effulgence.
</p>

<p>
I was almost sorry to come back to sordid civilization,
crooked streets and mean houses and dark ways.
Taverns and hotels hung out lights; the rest of the
town was buried in darkness. Here and there some one
had raised a sidewalk; you went up two or three steps
and then went down again. But there was often a
candle burning in a window.
</p>

<p>
Father was pacing up and down the path. We had
a front fence now to keep out strays, though we could
drive them to the pen.
</p>

<p>
"I began to think you were never coming back.
Nanny Piaget came and told me. Dan Hayne, you
must have been struck in a new spot, gallivantin' a lot
of young ones round; and you so choice of that mare
you hardly let a stray hand touch her. She's splendid,
but my advice to you is to give up racing and all that
and settle down, marry and have young ones of your
own; but I'll venture a five months' shoot you won't
be careering round prairies half the night with them.
Ruth, ain't you going to light and let Dan go
home?"
</p>

<p>
I held out my arms to father. Dan bent over and
kissed me on the mouth, then handed me down.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Gaynor, I think you're long headed buying all
prairie land," he said. "It'll be a fortune for the Little
Girl some day."
</p>

<p>
"Meanwhile it'll raise corn and feed hogs," father
said with a chuckle. "Ruth, ain't you going to give a
word of thanks for your safe return? Why Dan might
have broken both your necks."
</p>

<p>
"Dan ain't that kind," laughed the young fellow in
his proud strength. "Good-night, little one. John, I
wish you'd go down to the Wabash with me and look
at some cattle—say, in about ten days."
</p>

<p>
"I'll see," returned father.
</p>

<p>
I felt stiff and strange, as if I must walk on a sort
of gallop and had no strength to do it. M'liss was all
curiosity and insisted that we must have gone to the
end of the world, and the supper was cold and not fit
to eat because she had "het it over and over."
</p>

<p>
I did not want much and went to bed very soon. I
still felt bewitched.
</p>

<p>
We all talked of our rides the next day at
school, and thought Chita the most splendid horse in
Chicago.
</p>

<p>
After Sunday School Polly Morrison came over
with a curious glitter in her eyes and snatched at my
hand.
</p>

<p>
"That was a pretty caper you cut up with Dan
Hayne!" she said in a sharp, angry tone. "If you
begin this way you'll be the talk of the town in a year
or two."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't want to go at first," I answered rather
resentfully. "But then it was splendid."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"My advice to you is to keep out of Dan Hayne's
way. Still, you're nothing but a chit! Set your cap
for Homer or Ben."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to set it for anybody," I returned,
jerking my arm away.
</p>

<p>
One confessed to liking boys, and boys and girls
played together, but lovers were quite different, not to
be expected until you were grown up, and most of the
courtships were very pronounced and rather brief. It
was a sort of settled matter that Dan and Polly, who
were unlike the average, would make a match some
day. They sparred, and, like the smaller children,
"made up," danced, went out riding—she had a saddle
horse—and then for weeks tossed their heads loftily at
each other. He went off down the Wabash and then
to Cahokia, but Polly did not lack for attendants.
</p>

<p>
How busy the town seemed. Now the canal started
afresh. Some of the old indebtedness was wiped out.
The land along the border was sold in plots, and men
set to work on a new basis. To hear them talk, it
sounded as if values increased daily.
</p>

<p>
Sophie Piaget and I became very dear friends. I am
not sure but I ought to include Homer. If he came to
our house first we walked down to the Piagets; if
Sophie came up we spent the evening in some simple
games. Neither she nor Homer cared much for books.
But she was very industrious and handy, with a certain
French ingenuity, I suppose I ought to call it.
She and her mother did fine dyeing and they made
over gowns, or indeed concocted new ones. Sophie
could tie a bow to perfection, straighten out crumpled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
artificial flowers, and give them a touch of fresh color
that made them blossom anew. She really had the
beautiful side of an artist without the intellectuality.
But new countries have little demand for this. The
fine arts came later.
</p>

<p>
There was a long pleasant fall. Business was thriving.
Father built two new rooms on the house. We
were beginning to have parlors, though the old-fashioned
keeping room, where you sit and work and talk
to your friends, the spinning wheel in one corner, the
dresser with its drawers holding table linen, the shelves
above for the best dishes, the commodious settle
and the Boston rocker, hold a charm that modern
rooms cannot give, for they had the heart of family
life.
</p>

<p>
The winter brought great changes to me, set my
life in a different key, the octave above childhood, girlhood,
before the woman begins to unfold. I had been
undersized, a truly little girl. Now I suddenly shot up
like a sapling, not particularly thin, but slim, and outgrew
all my skirts. I felt very, very sorry. I did not
want to be grown up.
</p>

<p>
Sophie was delighted. Nanette kept pace with me.
So did Letty Dole and Bessy Hale. We were not
going to school. Fourteen was considered old enough
to begin the real work of life. I was not quite that,
but the house seemed to demand me. For M'liss, with
all her sorrow of widowhood, had consoled herself and
was to give her boy the strong hand to guide him
through perilous ways. On the other side, she was
to undertake two girls, six and eight. Mr. Weaver had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
a farm down south branch, kept cows and supplied
people with milk.
</p>

<p>
I was very sorry to have her go. I had grown fond
of the baby, who was a great chatterbox and extremely
funny little chap, and M'liss was an excellent cook,
good and strong, and housework was hard for girls
and women in those days.
</p>

<p>
There was all the new part to clean and set to rights.
We had a fine whitewashed wall and a thick soft rag
carpet. My chamber opened on this room as well as
father's. Then there was a big room upstairs that we
did not need at present.
</p>

<p>
M'liss was married in the morning and went to her
new home at once. We both cried at the parting, for
we were to be nearly two miles apart.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind anything so much as that," she said.
"If I could run in every day or two and cook a meal
for you. I don't believe that old Jolette will be worth
her salt, and you've studied books so much that I am
afraid your poor father'll starve."
</p>

<p>
Jolette was not so very old, perhaps forty, of rather
mixed Indian and negro extraction, quite tattooed by the
Indians. She had come up from Vincennes some years
before, and had three children, who were bound out
in various families.
</p>

<p>
"She'll do for the present," said father. "But I'd
like to have some nice kind of white woman who could
be motherly, and know what was fitting for a girl."
</p>

<p>
Father kept a boy now, a rather loutish young lad,
just the kind to do the rough work, chop wood and feed
the stock. Andy always came for me with a lantern
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
if I was out in the evening where the Hayne boys
could not see me home.
</p>

<p>
All the fall I had one happy thought in my mind—Norman
would be home when the winter broke up.
They had gone to New York, and were to visit Washington.
Mr. Le Moyne was deeply interested in some
trade relations that he expected to lay before the
governing powers at Washington. Norman was delighted.
To see the President and both houses of Congress
was beyond his wildest dream.
</p>

<p>
There was quite a merry making at Christmas.
March or before, Norman had said. And now what
with railroads coming to the fore and stage coaches,
journeys were more readily made, and letters reached
one oftener.
</p>

<p>
Then came the heart-breaking tidings. A long letter
beginning so bravely. New York had proved very
interesting with its landmarks of earlier times and its
peculiar location. Washington had still many signs of
newness. It had not grown by accretion, but been
planned at once, and all the plans had not been executed
as yet. But the capital and the White House
were superb. And the great squares that were to be
embellished in the future, the historic points, the adornments
progressing slowly, the Senate Chamber and
House of Representatives, and the great men of that
day were vividly described.
</p>

<p>
And then the change in all Norman's plans, the parting
for years instead of the happy meeting.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Le Moyne was going to France, charged with
some quite important and extensive trade matters that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
he understood thoroughly, and that might lead to
advantageous relations. That was sort of <i>sub rosa</i>
not to be generally announced. An intelligent secretary
might perhaps do the work, but Mr. Le Moyne
needed more than this. His eyesight was failing fast
with some obscure trouble that did not in the least
affect their appearance. He had written to an eminent
surgeon at Paris, who held out some hope of help. At
New York the leading doctors had said there was no
possibility of arresting total blindness. Mr. Le Moyne
was still in the prime of middle life, and this verdict
was appalling.
</p>

<p>
And now he really could not do without Norman.
They were like father and son. He was an excellent
French scholar, and had also taken up Latin. He read
to Mr. Le Moyne, wrote his letters, accompanied him
everywhere. "I watch all that goes on as well as read
the papers daily, and am really eyes to him. He is
sensitive on the point and scarcely acknowledges his
misfortune, but you can see how very dependent he
must be on some one. And he has trained me to his
habits and methods. He has the loveliest and most sincere
nature, his friendship is the greatest boon a young
fellow can have. I should be an ingrate to leave him
now when he has pleaded for me to stay. It is not altogether
for the advantages, though they are many, but
my sympathies go out to him in the strongest manner.
I could not refuse, although I longed to fly back to you
all. And it is the uncertainty that pains me most.
It may be a year—it may be—I dare not think. But
he likes America, and expects to return even if the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
worst happens. I have had a delightful time—it would
take weeks to recount the pleasures and satisfactions.
If I could only see you for an hour. Are you still a
little girl? I cannot think of you as being large, as
ever being what people call grown up. Oh, keep little
until I come back, which must be in another year or
two."
</p>

<p>
I could not talk it over at first. I was glad when
father came in that he was in a great hurry to go to
some meeting, where they were considering measures
to be put into execution for the benefit of the city as
soon as spring opened, of broadening the river to give
it a better current, of building new wharves and
bridges. Improvement seemed to be the watchword
everywhere. I listened with a thankful heart. I was
so glad not to have him ask about a letter as he had
several times of late. So I brushed his coat and pulled
his stock around straight, and found him a clean handkerchief.
Then I went to bed with my sorrow, telling
Jolette I had a headache, and could see no one. Homer
came over—I heard his voice.
</p>

<p>
I re-read my letter the next morning. It was dull
and gray, with now and then little spits of snow, too
cold to snow, pedestrians said one to another. Jolette's
great comfort was smoking a pipe in the chimney corner.
Sometimes I quite longed for M'liss's inconsequent
talk, but I was glad to be alone to-day.
</p>

<p>
About mid-afternoon Mrs. Hayne came over.
</p>

<p>
"You poor child!" she cried. "Are you ill?"
</p>

<p>
The tears rushed to my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ruth, dear, don't take it so hard. I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
afeared you would. The people who go away are always
more to us than we are to them in their new lives.
But this is such a splendid thing that we oughtn't
grudge him the chance. It's a thousand pities for Mr.
Le Moyne, of course, and dreadful to be blind, but just
think of all the advantages. Seeing the President, and
actually going to a levee—did he tell you?—and wearing
a tail coat—the old fashions coming round. I
wonder if they have brass buttons! My gran'ther
had. Why, I never s'posed a son of mine would be
there or go to Paris! And you can't tell but what one
of the boys will be President!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed gayly at the conceit.
</p>

<p>
"Then the salary! Of course people are making
money here, but seems to me property's up one day
and down the next. Chris got out his map, and we
looked up Paris. It's hundreds of years old, but my!
France can't begin with the United States, though
we're not half settled. And it's a great thing! They'll
go to England, too, and he will see kings and queens
and high dukes. Why, I think it's just grand. Only
I hope he won't forget us all or get up to such a degree
he will never want to come back."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he can't do that! He can't forget us!" I cried
with a rending pang at my heart.
</p>

<p>
"Well, not exactly that, but don't you see, Ruth,
that his life is going to be altogether different from
ours? Of course you can't understand how a mother
feels. She is glad to have her sons prosper, improve,
even if it does take them away from her. She gets old
and dies, and they have their new lives to live, so it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
all right. Betty Collins's son married a girl whose
father owned miles and miles of live oak timber, and
they've made a fortune somewhere in the Carolinas.
She's a great lady and wears velvet gowns and some
kind of lace that was forty dollars a yard—think of it!
And how she'd look setting foot in this muddy old
Chicago. It's good enough for us who live here right
straight along, but for ladies!"
</p>

<p>
She threw back her head and laughed. She was not
at all dismayed, rather elated.
</p>

<p>
Well, it was a fine opportunity. And then to be held
in such high esteem!
</p>

<p>
"How are you getting along with your black woman?
And your new rooms! Husband's talking of building,
our house is old, and we're crowded, and no mistake.
I do wish Dan would see some nice girl out
there," nodding her head, "and marry her. Homer's
counting on getting married when he's twenty-one,
but I tell him to get his cage first. Birds are easily
captured. Homer's nice and steady, and he's saving,
too. He will make a first-class husband. I have my
eye on a girl for Ben," and her smile brought a warm
color to my cheek.
</p>

<p>
"I hear your father's taking great interest in all the
goings on. They talked high in '37. Why, you'd
think the earth would be so full of people there'd
hardly be standing room, and there's all to the Mississippi
River. Not but what the town wants clearing up
bad, but we don't want another panic."
</p>

<p>
She had been knitting as she talked. I liked to hear
the rattle of her needles, they kept such exact time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Would you mind reading your letter? You're doing
nothing, I observe."
</p>

<p>
I went in the other room and laid out the page that
had the most tenderness and longing in it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," she subjoined in a pause. "It's pretty
much the same as mine, only those things about books
and his learning Latin, I don't sense that," was her
comment.
</p>

<p>
"'Twould be awful if that nice man should go
blind. Then I s'pose Norman would think to stay
with him as long as he lived. Well, he will have a
good time, no doubt, and we mustn't murmur s'long as
he's prosperous. And he may pick up some nice girl.
Goodness me! Look at that snow! I must trot off
home. Come over, we miss you so much. And don't
feel too disappointed about Norman. I'd counted on
seeing him sure."
</p>

<p>
She put up her knitting and bustled about, tied her
ears up with her woollen hood, and set off cheerily.
Yes, we were in for a storm, the flakes were like a
great army sweeping over the land. But it was splendid!
There was no wind to hurry them, they could
take their time and be beautiful.

<h2>
CHAPTER XI
<br />
A TIME FOR LOVE
</h2>

<p>
Everybody rejoiced in Norman Hayne's good fortune.
There was another point in it that sent a pang through
my heart. Would he outgrow and forget?
</p>

<p>
Another friend went out of my small circle in the
spring, Mrs. Chadwick. Her husband had established
a business in Buffalo, and they moved thither. I did
not realize then the valuable friend I had lost. I was
more interested in the young girls' good time. Homer
Hayne was always ready to escort Sophie and myself
to the little parties and merrymakings. Just now Dan
had one of his periodic fancies for Polly Morrison, and
his mother was much troubled about it.
</p>

<p>
"But if they love each other?" I said. It really
seemed to me that they must, and now I had begun to
speculate a little on this mysterious power.
</p>

<p>
"Child," she replied almost sternly, "that kind of off
and on business isn't love at all, and the great question
is whether they can spend a life together, and take up
all the cares and perplexities and help each other along,
steady them, comfort them, tide over the rough places
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
that come in all lives. It isn't all dancing and driving
about with a fast horse or careerin' over the prairies,
racing like mad. I don't believe Polly knows how to
do a single useful thing. Her old grandmother's
always been one of the high and mighty ones, and
danced with two or three of the Presidents. Maybe
they were big people in Maryland, and she gets some
money twice a year from her people there. They've
just got that house and garden. Morrison was a nice
kind of man, but then he died, and Mis' Morrison just
slaves herself to death taking care of that queer old
crittur that doesn't look like any sort of human being
now. I hope to goodness I'll never live to look like
that, as if the crows had picked me, an' eyes like two
burnt holes in a blanket."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hayne paused, all out of breath. I couldn't
imagine her ever looking like Granny Verrinder. Mrs.
Morrison did not resemble her mother in the least,
though she must have been past both youth and beauty
when she was married. How they had come to drift
to this place might have puzzled people curious about
their neighbors' antecedents. Polly had been born
here. From grandmother's early years to Mrs. Morrison's
marriage there seemed a hiatus about which they
never talked. Mrs. Morrison was a meek, quiet, hard-working
woman. I think now she could never have
known what to do with Polly, but whatever she did
granny traversed. She, the elder, quarrelled with the
girl, and yet she adored her and brought out her old
finery to adorn the madcap for the dances and merrymakings.
But Polly held her head as high in her blue
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
homespun gowns. The good time was all to her no
matter if it was in a log cabin with a black fiddler.
</p>

<p>
"The kind of wife Dan wants is a good, modest girl
of strong principles who can keep a clean, cheerful
home and cook well. Poor feeding has ruined many
a man, and children are his salvation. I hope Dan's
wife will have a houseful. You see, a man begins to
think about the future when there's sons to grow up.
I've always wanted one girl, but Hayne was mighty
fond of boys and that sort of 'leviated things. But
I do hope and pray that with all their wives there'll
be one I can take to my heart like an own daughter."
</p>

<p>
The little house of the Morrisons had only two
rooms and a lean-to kitchen. The front was grandmother's,
and had a carved high-post bedstead with
faded silk curtains from the tester poles. There was
a curious chest of drawers with a kind of cabinet that
had glass doors. Behind these were china and silver
that did betoken former grandeur. Granny drank
from the cups and took her sugar out of the silver
bowl, her milk from the silver cream jug. In pleasant
weather she sat out of doors a good deal in a great
chair stuffed around with pillows. It had rollers, and
when the street was passable she would sometimes be
pushed up and down by her daughter, who was a veritable
slave. A little shrivelled up old woman with a
long nose and a sharp chin, but her still fine teeth
would always keep them from meeting. She wore a
cap and a false front of faded black, and was bundled
up in shawls. Her stick kept away curious children.
I think they felt there was something uncanny about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
her. People had ceased to cultivate them, if they ever
had, but Polly was welcome for her fun and brightness.
</p>

<p>
I had noticed and Mrs. Chadwick had spoken of a
great improvement in the town. Education had really
begun to educate. Provincialisms, elisions, and what
father had called outlandish talking was falling into
disuse. Of course, families coming from different
States had brought in accents, pronunciations and
adages, some bright and to the point, it must be confessed,
but these were being toned down and refined.
I had been a good deal amused at the manner in which
Ben had corrected his mother, and she had protested
with the tart rejoinder, "that her talk was plenty good
enough for her, and she didn't expect to put on French
airs at her time of life," but she did take more pains.
</p>

<p>
Once she said, "Dear me! We shall all have to
spruce up when Norme comes back so he won't be
ashamed of us. I think father'll get the new house
also."
</p>

<p>
"Norme!" How dear the old boyish nickname
sounded.
</p>

<p>
I was just past fifteen when the real things began
to happen to me. The year had been very pleasant,
and I rather reluctantly did my hair up high and wore
a bonnet for Sunday best, and a long skirt—not very
long either—what they would have been like trailing
over dust and mud! Father was prospering, raising
wheat and pigs and corn and buying up a bit of property
or acres of prairie land. Jolette and I managed
very well. Mrs. Hayne occasionally suggested that
girls of fifteen ought to be able to keep house, but now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
we had two cows and a great flock of poultry. Jolette
made fine butter, and our eggs found a ready sale.
Even at that time we sent some across the lake, for
now vessels were coming and going continually, except
in extreme weather.
</p>

<p>
"I was married when I was sixteen and did my
washing and scrubbing and cooking. But such hands
as those don't look like near kin to a washboard;" and
she caught mine in hers so large and strong.
</p>

<p>
They <i>were</i> slim and small. We had not begun to
cultivate points of aristocracy in that early period, or
talk of claims to good birth, but I had often noted that
father's hands were small and shapely for all his hard
work, though I am not sure but he managed to get the
hardest and roughest out of other people.
</p>

<p>
We heard at intervals from Norman, who was busy
and full of enjoyment. Paris was wonderful. The
new physician had at first given Mr. Le Moyne a good
deal of hope, except that the treatment could not be
rapid. Then had intervened a really serious illness,
and during this time the optic nerve of one eye had
been paralyzed. After that a winter in Spain, which
was enchanting.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I see many years of exile before me,"
Norman wrote in my letter. "What can I do? Mr. Le
Moyne is the most delightful, the sincerest and certainly
the most generous of friends. Through his convalescence
he has said so many times, 'What could I
do without you, Norman, when I have no son or
nephew even?' He has one sister, who is an invalid
from a broken hip and partial paralysis, and her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
daughter is a fashionable and titled lady. He is very
fond of travelling and enjoys society, but now he
needs some one continually. I know he fears he will
be blind, and he wants to be sure of a permanent stay
and solace. Can I relinquish some of the best hopes
of my life—yet I feel that I ought. It seems as if
God had given me this work to do, that it was not of
my own seeking, and I must trust Him to make it right
in the end. It is very hard, but must I not go on
in this straight path? Pray that I may have strength,
little girl. If I could not see it so clearly, but I do,
and whatever may be said, remember that I would
rather come home without a dollar and trust for a welcome
than remain away years and reap a fortune."
</p>

<p>
But I thought even years, five or seven, would not
be so very long.
</p>

<p>
We had been down to the Piagets—Homer and I.
Mrs. Piaget was like a girl in her merry ways. We
had some guessing of proverbs and songs, a cup of tea
and cake, both very plain, but with the fun and frolic
most enjoyable. Just as we were saying good-night
we crossed hands, Sophie, Homer, Luther Chandler
and I.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a wedding, a wedding!" cried Nanette, and we
all blushed and laughed. "Sophie is the eldest, it is
her turn first."
</p>

<p>
Luther was very sweet on Sophie, but I thought she
did not care much for him.
</p>

<p>
Then Homer and I walked home.
</p>

<p>
"It's late, but I'm coming in," he exclaimed, and the
resolution in his voice roused me curiously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Jolette was in her chimney corner. During the cold
weather she rolled herself in a blanket and slept on the
old settle.
</p>

<p>
"Ye'r pop's gone to bed," she said with a sort of
grunt.
</p>

<p>
We went through to the keeping room. She had
mended the fire, and it was now blazing cheerfully.
Oddly enough, two chairs stood invitingly before it,
but I knew father did not like company staying late.
It seemed unsocial not to ask him to sit down.
</p>

<p>
"You make a room look different from any one else,
Ruth," he said, glancing around. "There is always an
air about it as if one really lived on a little higher
plane. Who would think of placing those pine boughs
in the corner, and having pictures and books around,
and always the newspaper and little knicknacks and
your work basket, and those pine cones with grass
growing in them," as his eyes wandered around.
</p>

<p>
"Was that what you came in to say?" I asked
saucily, for it amused me.
</p>

<p>
"No, it wasn't." He looked at the fire a moment,
then at me. I had both hands on the back of my low
sewing chair.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth, will you marry me? Could you love me well
enough to be my wife?"
</p>

<p>
I do not think the question took me quite by surprise.
Mrs. Hayne had made suggestions. Father had indulged
in a few comments such as "that he meant to
give Homer his walking papers—it was too soon for
any fellows to be hanging round." But we had been
such good friends, without a bit of sentiment, as if a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
girl of fifteen could understand what sentiment truly
was!
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Homer!" My voice almost failed in the great
tremble of every nerve. "Oh, what made you ask
it?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I wanted to know. Surely, Ruth, you will
tell me the truth, the whole truth. I've always been
fond of you, and it seems as if Norme left you to us
when he went away. You were only a little girl, and
he has companied so much with high and mighty folks
that I suppose he will be miles and miles above anybody
here. But mother's heart is set upon you, and she's
nagged me lately, as if she thought I wasn't—well, forward
enough. We're all fond of you, you know. If
you could—only I'm afraid—" hesitatingly, "that you
<i>don't</i> love me. A girl always shows it a little. We
seem just good friends—"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is all we are, Homer!" I cried, but my
face was scarlet with blushes, and my heart gave a
great throb of thankfulness. For I knew by some sure
insight, girl that I was, that he had no best of all love
to give me.
</p>

<p>
Then he reached over and took my hand.
</p>

<p>
"I think I could love you dearly, and oh, little Ruth,
I'd carry you in my arms or let you walk over me, and
spend my whole life thinking how I could make you
happy. I'd work day and night that you should have
the things you enjoyed. All that would be nothing if
you did not love me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, you understand. And so let us keep
friends. I think there is some one who could love you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
very dearly, who would be glad of your love, and you
would be very happy. I think you are saved for that."
</p>

<p>
He turned scarlet first, then deadly pale. "Sophie,"
he murmured just under his breath.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is Sophie. Homer, I have been hoping this
long while——"
</p>

<p>
"Mother would never forgive me if I passed you
by," he interrupted. "You see, I had to ask you. And
if you had said yes I should have bent every energy
toward making you happy. Yes, I would have done it.
But you're not quite—not like—"
</p>

<p>
"Not in love," I said smilingly. "That makes everything
easy, levels all inequalities, I have read somewhere.
Then I am still a little girl. I didn't want
to be grown up. I don't want any real lovers this long,
long while. And I shall be so glad for Sophie. She's
seventeen and just the right age, and so dear, and sweet,
and wise, and such a splendid housekeeper! Oh, you
will be so happy, and she will just run over with joy."
</p>

<p>
"What I wanted to say, though I do not know as I
can put it in the right words, is that you are not quite
like other girls. You're like a choice china cup, while
the every-day earthen wouldn't mind the dishwater so
much, you see," and he laughed. "Ben understands.
He said it wouldn't be fair, that you ought to have a
gentleman who loved books and cultivation, and all
that. And though I hope I'll be well-to-do some day,
I shouldn't ever care for the fancy things. Still I
wouldn't grudge them to the woman I loved. And
you ought to have the best—which isn't always money
either."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I didn't want to hear about myself, though I knew
then there was a great gulf between Homer and me
that only love could bridge over. Yet I did love him
dearly at that moment.
</p>

<p>
"And Sophie?" I interposed.
</p>

<p>
"It's queer, isn't it? And they say girls are always
jealous of each other. Ruth, you are the sweetest
little thing in the world. If Sophie didn't love you, I
don't know as I could ask her. And I shall tell her
just how it was. Of course, mother—she must know,
too, that I asked you. I like everything open and
above board. And I guess the sign will come right—that
crossing of hands," smiling.
</p>

<p>
"And you'll ask her soon? I want her to be happy."
I know my face was all eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"You may trust me for that."
</p>

<p>
The clock struck eleven.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth!" exclaimed a peremptory voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir." Children said sir and ma'am in those
days long after they were grown up.
</p>

<p>
We went through the old kitchen. Jolette was snoring,
but covered up head and ears, and the embers covered
over likewise. I let Homer out and fastened the
door. Then I went back to father. He was leaning on
one elbow, his head tousled and his eyes almost fierce,
but I did not mind.
</p>

<p>
"Was that Homer Hayne making a night of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, father," and I couldn't help a mirthful
sound.
</p>

<p>
"Did he ask you to marry him—the truth, child."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," and I could not forbear laughing. "But he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
is in love with Sophie Piaget, only his mother wanted
him to—to—"
</p>

<p>
Then father laughed and gave me a hug.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I knew that was in the air, but I thought I'd
head it off. Sophie! Well, she will make just the
right sort of wife for him. Ruth, chickabiddy, you're
too young to get tangled up in such things. You're
not to have any lovers for years yet. Do you hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father, I don't want any. I couldn't be any
happier if I had a dozen."
</p>

<p>
"A dozen! I hope it will never come to that. Not
even one in ever so long. There, little girl, give me a
good-night kiss and go to bed."
</p>

<p>
He held me in his arms for some seconds. Perhaps
it wasn't the fashion in those days, but people were
not generally effusive.
</p>

<p>
It rained the next day. I spun with a light heart,
looked after my hens and then knotted some fringe for
my curtains in a pretty way Sophie had taught me.
Father read the paper aloud. There was an Indian
war in Florida now, and some important political
questions discussed in a rather heated manner.
</p>

<p>
I really wanted to run down to the Piagets, the next
morning, but I resolutely refused myself. It was clear
and cold. Jolette made mince pies. Father had
brought the love of pie from his native State. What
an appetizing fragrance they diffused.
</p>

<p>
About mid afternoon I caught sight of Sophie slipping
about the frozen path full of hummocks, but she
balanced herself with a fascinating art. I ran to the
door.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wanted to see you so, I hoped you would
come. Of course you know. I am the happiest girl
in all Chicago! But if you had loved him—and often I
thought he loved you, and I stood no chance. I
wouldn't let mother speak—that is the French fashion,
you know—I was so afraid he might be affronted.
Luther had asked mother's permission, and she
thought it was time I was betrothed. But I couldn't
make up my mind to that. I've been gay and full of
fun, but sometimes my heart ached for very dread.
Only you are such a child!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes, it was ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
"But Mrs. Hayne loves you so. You'd do worlds
better for Ben."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to do for anybody."
</p>

<p>
"But Ben isn't grown up."
</p>

<p>
"And there's Chris, if Ben won't have me," I said,
with a sense of amusement at being handed down.
"And you understand—Homer asked me to please his
mother. Of course he likes me, but that isn't marrying
love."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are going to be the dearest little sister to
us. Oh, I do wonder if Mrs. Hayne will truly like
me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she will when she comes to know you well.
She has hoped so that Dan would marry, only she
didn't want Polly Morrison."
</p>

<p>
"And now they're at it again. This time everybody
thinks it will make a match. I don't like Dan. He's
the great Mogul, and he flirts awfully. I wouldn't be
his wife for half Chicago. But Homer is so sweet and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
patient and tender. He has some of your ways,"
smiling generously, "and he will build his house at
once. Oh, won't it be just splendid! I shall go to
work immediately. What a delight it must be to make
up one's trousseau. I have yards and yards of lace
knit, and fringe made. I shall not sell any more. Oh,
Ruth," studying me intently, "are you quite sure you
are happy over it? For you could have taken him—and
I don't see how you escaped loving him."
</p>

<p>
"Then you would have been unhappy. Now we are
both happy and content."
</p>

<p>
I came to know afterward that there were women
who fancied you were dying for their particular lover,
and it vexed me, and men who thought your world
could easily have been bounded by them.
</p>

<p>
I made Sophie stay to supper. Homer was not coming
that evening. He wanted to explain to his parents
and make some arrangements. Father wished her all
good fortune and teased her a little, admitting that she
would have one of the best of husbands.
</p>

<p>
I hesitated to make my weekly visit to Mrs. Hayne,
and the day I set it stormed. But I walked over with
Ben and Chris after Sunday School.
</p>

<p>
"You naughty girl," Mrs. Hayne began. "I don't
know when I can forgive you. I suppose you <i>were</i>
ashamed."
</p>

<p>
"What did she do?" asked Chris, eager eyed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she knows. There, you two boys, run off. I
want to talk to her and I don't want you catching
gabble seed."
</p>

<p>
They went reluctantly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I hoped he'd wait for you, he would have been
young enough then, and a chit like you don't know her
mind, though many a girl has been married at fifteen.
Sophie Piaget is a nice enough girl, industrious and all
that, but he might have looked higher. I don't quite
like the French of it, and the Catholic, though I'm not
bigoted. I never supposed you were helping things
along, or I'd put my finger in the pie sooner."
</p>

<p>
Had I helped it along? I had a guilty feeling.
</p>

<p>
"Father wouldn't hear to my being engaged or having
a real lover," I said with some dignity. "And—I
don't want one, I don't care about being married."
</p>

<p>
"You'll sing another tune presently. Though after
all," in a softer tone, "there is plenty of time."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER XII
<br />
NOT MERRY, BUT WEDDING BELLS.
</h2>

<p>
Mrs. Hayne did not feel comfortable over Homer's
engagement. It was a full fortnight before she could
make a formal call on Mrs. Piaget. She had been there
on errands, and Sophie and I were often at the Haynes'.
But she stopped for me one day, "since it had to be
done," she said, and we walked down together. She
was not at her best, though she had on her Sunday
clothes. Perhaps she would have felt more at ease in
her every-day ones. She was generally so cordial and
heartsome that I noticed and felt sorry for the stiffness.
</p>

<p>
Of course she said some pleasant things—that she
knew Sophie would make a good, industrious wife,
and that was what young men needed. She had no
patience with flyaways, and girls who were too good to
work, who were taking up the new ideas that you must
sit in the parlor and play on the piano, and have lace
undersleeves dangling about your wrists, and a tail to
your frock to sweep up the dirt everywhere. Clothes,
she took it, were made for use and comfort.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Women were wearing very full skirts, and all around
the back they "dipped" and had to be held up in the
streets. Sleeves were wide and flowing with lace or
fine muslin ruffles inside. Some had an edge of needlework,
but if that came from the convents in Canada it
was costly, and the younger girls were doing it for
themselves. They took their work along when they
went to make calls, and calls then were an hour
or so long between friends, and you "laid off your
things."
</p>

<p>
There was coming to be quite a circle of what was
considered afterward "the first people," and who had
streets named for them. There were the Newberrys
and Owenses, the Hamiltons and Pecks and Roberts,
the Menards and Nobles, and Baubeins and Kinzies,
who seemed the fathers of the town, and talked of the
block house and the few cabins around it, the attack
on the fort, and the Indian skirmishes. When you listened
to them Chicago seemed really old.
</p>

<p>
Then there was only one set, with the clergymen having
the place of honor. Now there were several circles,
not strongly defined, and living in amity, but each
one choosing its own friends. The cream went out
shopping when the new goods came in, and no longer
wore homespun. Their sons and daughters went away
for the finishing touches in education.
</p>

<p>
The Haynes were then in what we should call the
middle class. There were some fine French people,
but they seemed a little colony to themselves, as well
as the Germans. I liked all the French people I had
met very much, perhaps I was drawn to them by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
thought of Norman in Paris. I did admire their
courtesy and a certain dainty politeness as if they always
knew just the right thing to do, and did it graciously.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Piaget brought out her best cake and wine.
She had some fine embroidered napkins, others done in
exquisite drawn work, and her glasses were clear and
fine, letting the tint of the wine shine through. And
the cake was delicious. She always flavored it. She
had the art of making flavors and scents, and their
clothing had an indescribable fragrance.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," Mrs. Hayne said, when we had left the
house, "that's done with, and I've been dreading it.
Sophie will make a nice wife, I dare say, but I think
Homer could have found some good American girl.
There's Kate and Annie Noble. They always ask him
to their gatherings, and Mr. Noble said to father that
he was a smart, level-headed fellow, and would make
his mark. I've been counting on my boys marrying,
and I've wanted some one I could company with and
feel to like as an own daughter."
</p>

<p>
"But Sophie is very sweet and affectionate," I ventured.
</p>

<p>
"She's French. The old saying is that 'blood's
thicker 'n water.' And she'll have her ways, and her
friends, and they'll jabber that everlasting tongue that
you can't make head nor tail of until you wish there
hadn't been any Tower of Babel, and everybody had
gone on talking the same language."
</p>

<p>
I laughed at that. How queer it must have seemed
when no one understood any one else!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"And I s'pose Norman will come home with some
fine French body who can't comb her hair nor put on
her stockings nor shoes, and must have a maid, as old
Granny Verrinder talks about. What better off is she
for all the fuss! Granny Pettingill is eighty, and she
can spin on the big wheel, and knit and sew, and is
worth a dozen of that other old thing, that's wearing out
her daughter's life. I don't know what you'd do with
a dozen. I'd bundle 'em up in a bag an' drop 'em in
the lake."
</p>

<p>
Mother Hayne was forgetting Ben's training, and
dropping back into her elisions, which showed that she
was rather short in the temper.
</p>

<p>
I was truly sorry about it all. Yet I could not wish
it different. And when Sophie ran over in the edge
of the evening I tried to comfort her.
</p>

<p>
"She doesn't like me, I can see that," she said with a
catch in her breath that was like a sob. "And I feel
so sorry for Homer. He has counted on our all being
so happy together, and I would try to be like a true
daughter, only she is so stiff I shall always feel afraid."
</p>

<p>
"I think she will get over it. She has such a good
warm heart. I'm quite sure it will get settled by the
time you are ready to be married," I said hopefully. I
couldn't imagine Mrs. Hayne holding out.
</p>

<p>
"We're going to have a betrothal party. Mother
was waiting for her call to settle that, and Mr. Hayne
has given Homer a lot. It's almost out on the prairie,
but if the Wrights don't mind living there we oughtn't.
We've been planning it—he's going to build two rooms
quite to the middle of the lot, and when he gets forehanded,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
as you Americans say, he will put up a nice
front."
</p>

<p>
Father thought that an excellent idea. Homer came
and talked it over with him, and I think he was much
pleased.
</p>

<p>
Then there was the betrothal party. They had a
new priest now at St. Mary's—Father Fischer, and he
was very gracious and kindly. The ceremony seemed
as solemn as a marriage to me. But it was true that
most of the guests were French. I was beginning to
talk quite well, and felt really at home among them.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what we should do without you,"
Homer said, squeezing my hand. "You must coax up
mother, and we will try to do our best. Sophie's the
one girl in the world to me, and yet I love you just the
same. But the sweetest of all is having the girl glad
to come to you."
</p>

<p>
After Père Fischer had given them a second blessing
and gone, with some of the elders, old Billy Griffin
came in with his violin, and we had some dancing, with
plenty of cake and a kind of cordial made out of spiced
fruits, that was quite harmless.
</p>

<p>
Dan had come in and seemed a good deal interested.
I danced with him, but Sophie said it was long and
short division. I was still growing and almost as tall
as Sophie.
</p>

<p>
After that we began to plan for the wedding outfit.
The night of her betrothal Mrs. Piaget had given
Sophie her string of gold beads. She had one of not
very choice pearls, but pretty, I thought, which would
be Nanette's, six of her silver teaspoons, three tablespoons
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
with the mark of a Paris silversmith on them,
and some quaint china dishes, as well as a fine pewter
basin. Then there was a cream silk gown with dainty
flowers sprinkled over it, some of her mother's youthful
finery, that would be made over into the wedding
gown.
</p>

<p>
As for sheets and blankets and table linen, they were
to be evolved somehow, and pretty underwear, so dear
to a girl's heart. There was still a scarcity of money
about, and so one had to exercise one's wits.
</p>

<p>
The town was thrown into quite a ferment that entirely
eclipsed our simple engagement. A Frenchman,
one Pierre Maseurier, had been up to Chicago some
weeks. He was much interested in the canal and trade
generally, and had a large place at Vincennes, as well
as some sugar interests in Louisiana. Small, old, but
sharp and eager, as if he were just beginning life, instead
of having it more than half spent. What brought
him into contact with Granny Verrinder no one could
explain, but he was quite a frequent caller. Suddenly
the little town was astonished at another betrothal.
Whether Polly Morrison had captured him, a widower
of long standing, with two married sons, or whether
he had tempted her with the brilliant prospect, no one
could tell. She curtly dismissed her old admirers,
there was an elaborate wedding gown sent for, and
Polly, dressed in sumptuous furs and covered with a
white wolf robe, was driven about as if she were a
queen.
</p>

<p>
Two days after a night's debauch, Dan Hayne left
for Buffalo. He knocked down a friend who offered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
him a teasing condolence, but vouchsafed no explanation
to any one. Then there was a wedding at St.
Mary's, with a nuptial mass and all the accessories of
state. Bishop Quartier came up to marry them, and
the lovely Saint Palais, who was afterward Bishop of
Vincennes. It was a grand affair, and it seemed as if
the whole town turned out. Polly looked as handsome
as if she had just stepped out of a picture, and most
people wondered afterward, for she had never been
considered a beauty.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hayne felt so much relieved that she began to
take a warmer interest in Sophie and the new house.
There were other mothers who gave thanks, no doubt,
for wild, wilful Polly had been a terror to them.
First it was one lover sighing at her feet and then
another. She certainly did delight in using her wiles
on other girls' lovers, not that she wanted the admirers
either, but just to try her power. There was only one
man who won her heart as I came to know afterward,
but money and position outweighed love.
</p>

<p>
Of course she had taken M. Maseurier for the
luxury he could give her. No girl of eighteen would be
likely to marry a wizened-up old man past sixty if he
were poor. Everybody settled to that.
</p>

<p>
About six weeks afterward Granny Verrinder died
very suddenly, though she was past ninety-six. She
had been taken to her granddaughter's marriage, lifted
in and out of a coach, and so bundled up that no one
saw much of her except two staring black eyes. It was
supposed Mrs. Morrison would rejoin her daughter,
but whether granny had more money than any one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
thought, or that the wealthy son-in-law had made provision
for her, no one was quite certain. She repaired
and renovated her house, built on another room, distributed
the furniture around more comfortably, took
in an old negro woman, and though she did not enlarge
the borders of her friendship, she came to look less
careworn, went to church occasionally, and perhaps
found a little happiness. At least, she was exempt
from care.
</p>

<p>
We heard that Polly was living in great style and
had everything heart could wish.
</p>

<p>
Dan came back three or four weeks afterward and
went about his business as if nothing had happened,
held up his head and was in no wise broken hearted.
Indeed, I thought him improved. He took a real
interest in Homer's house, advanced him some money,
so that he could meet bills promptly, and was pleasant
and brotherly to Sophie, who had always felt a little
afraid of him.
</p>

<p>
It was a very delightful spring and early summer to
me. Father was prosperous and jolly, and we were so
interested in completing the trousseau and house equipment.
When one goes out and orders a long list, has
them sent home and put in their places, one misses the
delight and interest of real home-making.
</p>

<p>
Then the wedding day was set. It would be in the
church, of course, and that did fret Mrs. Hayne. There
was no great fuss about mixed marriages then, though
good Père Fischer hoped in his pleasant manner that
sometime Homer would be numbered among those of
the true faith.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Nanette and I were bridesmaids. I had a sheer
white muslin frock and a wide white satin sash that
came down to the very bottom of the skirt. There
were no picture hats, but we each wore a wreath, and
Sophie her mother's wedding veil, that then was folded
up and laid away in a box for Nanette, who was free
to have lovers now.
</p>

<p>
The wedding was at noon, and Mrs. Hayne gave a
generous dinner, tables being set in both rooms.
Sophie made a sweet and blushing bride, Homer was
fine and manly. Dan made the speech of the occasion,
and everybody drank to the health of the bride
and groom and wished them children and grandchildren.
</p>

<p>
About mid-afternoon the procession started for
home. Dan took Nanette, Ben and me in his two-seat
wagon. There was to be an evening company, an
"infair," as it was called, in the new house. The bedstead
and bedding had been stored in the shed, the two
rooms were decorated with vines and flowers and
hanging candlesticks and lamps, so that in the evening
the lights would be in no one's way.
</p>

<p>
Randolph Street was a lane then with but few
houses, and out beyond stretched the prairie that was
to be a compact city long before the century ended.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do hope you won't be lonesome way out
here," I said to Sophie.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I shall have Homer, you know," opening her
eyes wide as if she thought my wish inconsequent.
</p>

<p>
"But not in the daytime."
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall be busy about my work."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Why I thought we had done sewing enough to
last seven years," I said gayly.
</p>

<p>
"Well—there will be cooking for a hungry man, and
I don't mean that Homer shall wish for his mother
when meal time comes. And Mr. Hayne thinks it will
be a good thing for Homer to bring his shop over here.
Chicago is building up so fast, and it will have to stretch
out every way. Then a good deal of the time he will
be home to dinner. You and Nan and the girls will
visit me—oh no, I shall not be lonesome."
</p>

<p>
She was so happy. And though it had not the brightest
beginning, Mother Hayne came to take great comfort
in her daughter.
</p>

<p>
We had a merry time with some new plays and
dancing. Mr. Hayne took several of the older people
home, then his wife, Nanette and myself.
</p>

<p>
"Well, they've had a very nice time and started fair,
and they'll get along all right," said the satisfied
motherly voice.
</p>

<p>
"Homer has a long head. I shan't have made a fortune,
but I look for my sons to be some of the rich men
of Chicago. Dan knows how to make money, and
if he learns how to keep it, he'll be all right. I dare say
that blind Frenchman will do well by Norman, and
Ben's steady going. I shouldn't wonder if Chris turned
parson," and he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Dan's like his old self," returned Mrs. Hayne. "I
don't know when I've set so much store by him as
I have this last week. That girl was a sort of a witch,
I do believe, and she just upset every man that she set
her eyes on. There's 'Lias Gordon gone to the dogs,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
hasn't drawn a sober breath since her wedding day.
'Twas said she promised to marry him, but I don't believe
that. She was looking for the best chance. And
I don't just see how all this good luck came to her.
But she'll have to carry herself mighty straight, or that
old fellow will beat her, you could see it in his eye, and
'twould serve her just right. I give thanks, like good
old David, seven times a day that she's out of Dan's
way."
</p>

<p>
I missed Sophie and the excitement, though some
new girl friends came in, and Ben was my devoted
cavalier. But one night he surprised me by a very
naïve confession. Were the Haynes, little and big,
bound to own me?
</p>

<p>
He had been descanting on Homer's happiness, which
was ideal, of course.
</p>

<p>
"The right thing for a man to do is to get married
when he reaches a certain place," began Ben gravely.
"And I've some plans—I'm going in Hamilton's real
estate and law office. They want a clerk. There isn't
any more money in it, but I'm going to study law.
I've been thinking of it this good while. I've listened
to the men talking politics, and I'm awfully interested
in that smart Stephen A. Douglas. Ruth, this is going
to be a great country, and it will need more and more
people to govern it. A State can have only two senators,
but as her population increases she has
more representatives, and that takes a man to Washington.
Then there are judges and governors of
States."
</p>

<p>
"And Presidents," I laughed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Only one every four years. Seems to me they tie
his hands behind his back, and then grumble because
he doesn't pull up every weed. He doesn't have so
much power, after all. But I'd like to be in public life
somewhere, to work on the souls or beliefs of men. It's
a grand thing!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ben!" I was amazed. Quiet, apparently contented
Ben!
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm going to set out for that. If you don't
put up a mark you can't help shooting at random.
Of course it will take a long while and hard study, but
one reason why I like you so much is that you're fond
of books, and have more real sense than most girls.
And, Ruth, you could be a perfect lady. It's born in
some people, and when it isn't they never get quite up
to the mark."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you," I returned, amused, as he made a
little pause. "On what pedestal am I to be put?"
</p>

<p>
I had no idea of what he would say, and somehow
I was not a little bewildered by his ambitious projects.
</p>

<p>
"Well, when I get up to the place where I can care
for a wife, I want you. You would read and study
and talk with a fellow, and keep him up to the mark,
too. I was glad you didn't want to marry Homer, not
but what he will make a splendid, devoted husband, but
house and wife and children will be his boundaries.
He will vote the Democratic ticket because his father
did, not from any principle or conviction. Oh, do you
remember how you and Norman once quarrelled about
politics?" and he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"But, Ben—I—"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He made a gesture with his hand, and I never understood
before how much fine dignity Ben possessed.
</p>

<p>
"After all this, if you haven't really fallen in love
with any one else, I shall ask you. But if you do meet
with any one you prefer this must not stand in the
way. I don't believe you will be the kind of girl who
is always reaching out after lovers. Your father will
want to keep you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is it," I interrupted. "Father has forbidden
my having any lovers for a long while yet."
</p>

<p>
"We will be friends just as we have been. I'll come
and talk over my plans with you. Mother, you see,
wouldn't understand. I like your father's bright, trenchant
remarks, too. There's some width to his brain.
But all the other will be put off until the right time
comes—laid away on the shelf of the future, not to be
meddled with. And now if father scolds about my
throwing up a good business chance, you will understand
why I do it."
</p>

<p>
I could not have helped admiring Ben. He had such
a good, strong face. All the boys were well looking,
none as handsome as Dan, but it seemed to me later on
in life as if each to a certain degree carried his character
in his face.
</p>

<p>
"So now we have had a good talk," continued Ben—he
had done all the talking—"and we understand the
ground we go upon. You know you are the dearest
girl to all of us. I shall never forget the night you
came. And we will be the best of friends."
</p>

<p>
Could I refuse when the tender eyes looked up so
confidently?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"The best of friends," I returned, and I felt the
solemnity of my own voice.
</p>

<p>
It was true that Ben's new plans were rather frowned
upon. His employer was sorry to lose him.
</p>

<p>
"There's lots of money made in speculation," said
Mr. Hayne, "and lots lost as well. Stands to reason
values can't always increase, and immigrants can't always
come in. We have a big country, with other lakes
and rivers, and the whole Atlantic coast for shipping.
Then it seems rather shifty business to me for steady
company."
</p>

<p>
Ben did not mind, however. There were some new
and exciting questions to greet the new President and
his Cabinet. The boundary of Oregon and British
America almost stirred up warfare, and a new difficulty
loomed up when the State of Texas, an independent
principality, asked to enter the Union. Mexico objected,
and there was a talk of war. We had many
things on hand, streets and the muddy old river, and
at last the canal that was going to do so much for us
approaching completion. Every year a greater demand
for wheat and corn and live stock. Father added field
to field, it seemed a passion with him.
</p>

<p>
The next spring there came a little girl to Homer
and Sophie Hayne. I think Mrs. Hayne was the gladdest
of all. The little girl of her own blood that she
had so longed for. A sweet, good little thing who
seldom cried and smiled readily.
</p>

<p>
They were all prosperous. Homer began to build
houses and sell them. Dan was steady, and turning
his attention largely to cattle raising and buying, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
had an interest in packing. He had a room now at the
hotel, and seemed to care little for girls, though he was
not averse to social pleasures. His one passion was
Chita, who was kept beautifully groomed. He raced
her now and then. She was the mother of a splendid
colt. He used to talk to her as if she was a human
being, and I think she understood every word.
</p>

<p>
As for Mr. Le Moyne, the treatment had failed.
Norman had promised to remain with him. They
would reside in Paris and travel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER XIII
<br />
THE SHADED SIDE
</h2>

<p>
I was having a happy girl's life with friends and pleasures.
Nanette Piaget had a lover, a young French
Canadian, who became enamored of prairies, and saw
boundless possibilities in wheat. He had some money
and would settle in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
One day father was brought home from a bad fall,
unconscious; they feared at first that he was dead. I
was stunned. Mrs. Piaget came over and one of our
neighbors, Mrs. Lewis.
</p>

<p>
They found his hip was badly broken. Three physicians
worked over him, and after some hours he was
bandaged. One doctor remained all night, and Mrs.
Lewis stayed. She did a good deal of nursing, and
made her home with a married daughter.
</p>

<p>
Fever set in, and there followed six weeks of danger.
I don't know what would have happened, but Dan
Hayne took charge of the outside matters. The wheat
had been cut and was to be brought in, a splendid crop
it was.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Everything grows its best for your father," he
said. "This is the first setback he has had."
</p>

<p>
Everybody was very kind. But I had never known
sorrow or anxiety, and the saddest of all was not to
do anything that would help. He had to lie still and
suffer. In the height of the fever he was strapped to
the cot, to keep him from doing any worse injury to his
hip. Mrs. Hayne coaxed me to come down and stay a
few days, but I had an awful fear that father would
die. Or he might come to consciousness and ask for
me. Now and then he talked of our journey from the
old Bay State, and murmured, "Little girl, little girl,"
but he did not realize that the little girl was at his side
whenever she was allowed to be.
</p>

<p>
There were a few days when he hovered between
life and death and dozed most of the time. Then he
opened his eyes and looked at me and said in a tremulous
tone, "Ruth."
</p>

<p>
"Father!" I caught his thin white hand and covered
it with kisses and tears.
</p>

<p>
He drew a long breath. "I've been pretty sick,
haven't I? How long has it been—a fortnight?"
</p>

<p>
"Almost two months."
</p>

<p>
"Two months! And the wheat—the corn—ruined!
And what is the matter with my side? I can't move
my leg. Why, I don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"You were hurt by a fall. You have been very ill
with a fever. And now you are better. You are going
to get well."
</p>

<p>
I leaned my head down on his shoulder and cried.
I could not help it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Poor little girl!" he said. "Poor little girl!"
</p>

<p>
Then Dr. Carpenter came in, and I know he was
greatly relieved.
</p>

<p>
"But we are not out of the woods!" He shook his
head dubiously. "You can blow out your candle very
easily, but with care you may burn it to the socket.
Still you have had a mighty tight squeeze. And there
must be no crying over him," shaking his finger at
me.
</p>

<p>
"Except for joy," I retorted, wiping my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I do begin to recall things, but I had no idea I had
been ill so long. And my hip—my leg?"
</p>

<p>
"It was a very bad break. It hasn't gone on as we
hoped, the fever was too much for it. But we
think it will be all right in the end. It will be a
winter's job, and call for a good deal of patience."
</p>

<p>
Father groaned and covered his face with his hands.
</p>

<p>
"You may be dismissed, little maid," with a smile
and gesture of the hand, "we have some secret rites to
perform."
</p>

<p>
I went out and hugged Jolette in my joy.
</p>

<p>
"I knowed 'twas all right," said Jolette. "I've harked
to dat ar schreech owel an' never yet counted t'ree.
T'ree jes' sure sartin', fer a death. An' the candile
didn't roll up a windin' sheet in de new of the moon.
As fer dogs howlin,' you can't depend on dem no mo',
'ceptin dey run right in de sick room."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lewis had stayed with us nearly all the time,
making a call now and then at her daughter's. She
returned before the doctor went away, and declared
that she, too, expected favorable word, for she had seen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
a change the last three days. "And if one doesn't drop
off sudden, they're sure to pull through."
</p>

<p>
Dan came in every night and I told him of the comforting
verdict.
</p>

<p>
"I thought he'd pull through. You see, he's wiry,
and a steady man, too. Had everything in his favor,
but it was a tight squeeze."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dan, you've been so good, so splendid!" and I
caught his hand, looking up with tears in my eyes. "I
don't know what we should have done without you."
</p>

<p>
"Remember that some day."
</p>

<p>
I did not understand the words nor the tone.
</p>

<p>
The next was Sunday, and many of the neighbors
were in. I was not needed, and I went to Sophie's
with the good tidings. The baby was so sweet and
cunning. There had been quite a time about naming
it. They both decided upon Ruth, but there was grandmother,
who would have felt hurt if left out. Elise and
Elizabeth were so much alike they could compliment
both in the same name. So it was Ruth Elizabeth,
but Homer always called her Little Girl. What would
Chicago be when she was sixteen? Men would be
describing old Chicago as they did now. But the log
houses would be gone, and the plain brick houses were
not picturesque. Would there be any old Fort Dearborn?
And some of the Indians had thought it wiser
to move further back. The wheat and oats and corn
were trenching upon the ground to which they really
had no claim. They still had their ball games and
their races, the ambition of every young brave was to
own a horse. Work for anything else they would not.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
The squaws supplied them with clothing. They fished
and hunted, but the squaws tilled the fields, did bead
work, made curious chains of polished shells, that
looked as if they were set with gems. They seemed
happy, too, but at middle life they were wrinkled old
women.
</p>

<p>
Saturday afternoon was a gala time. They had
games and dances, sometimes such fierce war dances
it seemed as if they would scalp each other. There
were stringent laws against selling them any quantity
of liquor, and the clergymen tried to rouse some moral
and intellectual ambition in them, but it was hard work.
Were they really the ornamental denizens of the
wilderness, and with the passing of that would they
disappear?
</p>

<p>
Homer and Sophie were glad of my good news. I
really was in an exultant state. And when Homer
took me home we found Ben there, who was delighted
and eager.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad," he said afterward, as we stood on the
old stoop, that now extended out to the edge of the
sidewalk. Father had raised us at least two feet. "I've
been thinking what I could do for you, and that I
ought to come in often, but I had a splendid chance to
learn German, which will take three evenings in a week.
And the disturbances in Europe send so many immigrants
over here. I don't wonder they love to get to
a free land, out of the reach of tyrants, and there is so
much to study."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ben," I replied, "don't worry about us. I dare
say some one will be in every evening when father is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
well enough to talk, and when he can go out a little—"
</p>

<p>
"It's you I am thinking about, and if I can be of any
service you will surely let me know."
</p>

<p>
I promised. How good they all were to me. Does
one recall past events more distinctly as one grows
older? I could always see myself as father lifted me
out of the old wagon, when I was half frightened at
such a host of boys.
</p>

<p>
Father improved very slowly, but his mind was clear,
and he had a good hope of being able to get about by
spring. I had known that Dan Hayne had been attending
to the place, but I was hardly prepared for the
accounting he gave father.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Dan," and father's voice was husky with
emotion, "things would have gone to the dogs if you
had not come to the fore. I don't know how I will
ever get straight with you."
</p>

<p>
Dan laughed. He had such a jolly, light-hearted
ring in his voice, just like his mother's.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't such a desperate sight, just to oversee.
The men seemed to know how to take hold. Gaynor,
I suppose you're a shrewd, long-headed Yankee, looking
at the end, instead of going off half cocked. You
have everything dovetailed, and one thing just fits
in with another. I've learned a lot of things these two
months and looked after my own affairs as well. I
think you're about right. Twenty or thirty years from
now we'll be feeding these people of the East, who
think they know a little bit more than all the rest."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't brought up in a slipshod fashion," returned
father dryly. "Though I don't wonder you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
people trust to chance. I never saw such pure luck in
my life as there is here—one can't call it anything
else."
</p>

<p>
Father had an excellent appetite and began to feel
real well at heart, as he termed it. Homer made him
a very convenient chair, that could be raised and
lowered by an ingenious crank and a set of pins. But
they found when the doctor and Jolette, who was good
and strong, stood him up that he had no power at all
over the hurt limb—very little feeling in it.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to tell me that I must be a one-legged
limpy Dick all the rest of my life?" he demanded
of the doctor. He was not a profane man
usually, but he did swear then.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we hope not. The joint has not mended as
we expected; it isn't sound. It's the worst break a
man can have to knock him out, but here it hasn't been
quite four months, and the fever was awful. A man
who could pull through that can pull through other
things. There is some paralysis, but when you come to
exercise even that may mend. I think it has improved
in a month. I give you a year before I lose
heart."
</p>

<p>
Father groaned, and when he took his hands from
his face I saw there were tears in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
But we made his room cheerful, and he could be
pushed about in his chair. Jolette was as good as a
masseur, she was so strong and vigorous. The doctor
instructed her how to rub him, and some medicaments
were used. We had a good fire blazing on the hearth.
Neighbors came in and played cards and repeated the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
general gossip. Then I read to him. We took the
<i>Democrat</i> now, and a new paper, the <i>Journal</i>, had been
started. He liked to hear all sides. Some of the ideas
he flatly contradicted, others he called fool talk. He
was very fond of arguing. He and Dan had it hot and
heavy sometimes, and I was afraid Dan would break off
in anger. I used to go to the door with him and say
pleadingly:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dan, you won't mind, will you? Remember
how ill father has been, and how awfully disappointed
he feels at not getting thoroughly well. He doesn't
mean all he says, and he would miss you terribly——"
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry, little one. I can make allowance.
Some of it amuses me, too."
</p>

<p>
Then he took my face in his hands and turned it up
a little until our eyes met. His were a deep gray.
There was a masterful expression in them that went
all through one. He stooped a little and kissed me with
what I understood later was the passion of a strong
man, and it left me as helpless for a moment as that
night of the wild ride.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, little dear," he said, and was gone.
</p>

<p>
"Such a dumb idiotic fool as Dan Hayne is in some
things! If I couldn't see an inch before my nose I'd
get some sort of a machine and pull it out longer. He's
all right on this slavery business—we don't want it here
at the North. And the tariff has two sides, I'm free
to confess. But some other matters——"
</p>

<p>
"I wish you wouldn't quarrel so much with him," I
interrupted. "And he is so good to us. You and Mr.
Harris always get along so nicely."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Shucks!" snorted father in disdain. "There's no
arguing where two people believe just the same things
in the same way, or pretend to. I like a man to have
some sharp opinions, if he does ram the points into you.
It's like a wrestling bout, and stirs up your blood.
Dan won't be so sure of things when he is forty."
</p>

<p>
I felt a little relieved. But the kiss burned upon my
lips and brought a curious heat to my cheek.
</p>

<p>
There was a young paper started about this time by
a Mr. Wright, who was always promulgating some
scheme for the public good. He was very eager and
earnest about public-school education, and the necessity
for children, who were to be the future rulers of the
State, to know what their duties were, and to be able to
undertake them. Many improvements in old Chicago
were owing to his fertile brain, and the energy and
ability to carry them through.
</p>

<p>
This particular one that interested father from its
first inception was the "<i>Prairie Farmer</i>." At the head of
it was this motto—"Farmers, write for your paper."
All kinds of agricultural questions were asked and answered
as correctly as possible for the limited knowledge
of that time. Experiences were exchanged—the
value of inventions and what might be done by
machinery. Some of those old ideas did get appropriated.
</p>

<p>
Father told me to draw up the table and bring him
pen and ink. He often looked over and straightened
up accounts. He kept every item and knew the returns
of different methods, always adopting the most
profitable one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This kept him busy for a long time. He had a
quill pen, and he chewed the end of it, wrinkled up his
brow, and shut his lips in a straight line so that you
could hardly see the color. Somewhere in the afternoon
he asked me to read a rather discouraging article,
and then said:
</p>

<p>
"Now listen to this, and it's no visionary thing
either."
</p>

<p>
He read a very spirited reply. I recognized at once
that some of it was his own experience.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father!" I cried, delighted, "you wrote it yourself.
It's splendid! And you ought to have it
printed."
</p>

<p>
"Good enough for that, eh?" He gave his quizzical
smile and twinkled his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; can't you have it put in the <i>Prairie
Farmer</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," with a sort of amused deliberateness, "I had
thought a little of that, since they are inviting plain
farmer people to air their wisdom. Do you think you
could copy it, not in a scratchy girl's hand, but one easy
to read? Sit here and try. I'm tired and feel like a
clock with its machinery running down. By the great
boot! I wonder if I am only to be half a man the rest
of my life!" and he gave a groan.
</p>

<p>
"But the better half is in good order, your head and
your hands, and Dr. Carpenter is sure you will improve
as soon as the weather is pleasant enough to get
out."
</p>

<p>
I arranged the little table just beside him. I was
happy to see him so interested. Then I began on odd
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
slips of paper to see what I could do writing large.
Father looked them over. I suppose it would have
made a modern girl nervous, but we knew nothing
about nerves in those days, and then I was so intent
upon pleasing him. My whole heart had been full of
sympathy all winter. I had never seen any one helpless
before but a baby.
</p>

<p>
"This I think will do. And you write only on one
side of the paper."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear," I cried, aghast, "think of all the paper it
will take!"
</p>

<p>
He made a funny little <i>moue</i>, as the French call it.
Paper was dear and poor. Foolscap was in general
use.
</p>

<p>
I did not get along very fast, and presently the dark
overtook me. So I put it away for the next day, but
I was all impatience.
</p>

<p>
"Call Jolette to let me down a little. And then stir
the fire."
</p>

<p>
Both were attended to. Then Ben ran in. He was
going home to supper, and this was German evening.
But he had two or three bits of brightness that amused
father.
</p>

<p>
I finished the paper the next morning, and we folded
it up and tied it with a cord, writing on the outside,
"To the Editor of the <i>Prairie Farmer</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Ruth," he said, "I wish you would take it
down to the office. I doubt if any one is in just at this
time, and so much the better. Lay it on the desk in
plain sight. And I dare say it will go into the waste
basket. But I believe that has been the result of some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
first efforts of people who came up to fame afterwards.
Don't stop to talk or explain, and I hope no one will
see you. Then we won't get laughed at."
</p>

<p>
"If anybody laughs at that"—my face was scarlet
and my eyes flashed—I could think of nothing bad
enough for punishment.
</p>

<p>
"There, there, run along."
</p>

<p>
Men were going to and fro to dinner. I threaded
my way hurriedly, and had a green veil tied over my
face. Through Randolph Street, here it was on the
corner of an alley way, "Prairie Farmer" over the unpretentious
door way. I peered in timidly. There was
a clumsy-looking boy with very red cheeks sitting on
a box and kicking his heels against it. There was also
a high square desk with four slim legs. I crossed over
to this and laid down the precious package.
</p>

<p>
"What cher want?" exclaimed the boy gruffly.
"Folks gone ter dinner."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," I replied. But before I had shut
the door curiosity jumped down with a thump and no
doubt satisfied himself.
</p>

<p>
Father was very well pleased with the adventure.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Little Girl," he said, giving my hand a
squeeze, as if it was the sign of a conspiracy, "don't
say a word or give a hint to a living soul, not Ben or
Sophie. We'll see what comes next week."
</p>

<p>
I laughed and nodded, and we crooked little fingers,
and said, "Honor bright."
</p>

<p>
But oh, what a long week it was. I think if later
on I had written a book and offered it to a publisher I
couldn't have been more anxious. I looked over the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
back numbers, and it didn't seem as if the articles were
truly any better, though some took up a wider range.
</p>

<p>
Those old papers were narrow and local. Boston,
mayhap, might have begun intellectual, but there was
too much work in Chicago in those early years to indulge
in flights of poesy or literary evolution. But
they were strong and earnest, full of boundless enterprise
and ambition, and the romance was to come later.
Indeed, the romance then outside of the real business
was marrying, having a home, and counting on what
the children would do in the next generation. They
did not think to build their Rome in a day, but they
could lay foundations, stretch out arms that would
bring the great world in its grasp.
</p>

<p>
I counted the days. Father said not a word about
it. And I could hardly wait until afternoon. Cold as
it was, I hung about the door-step and then ran down to
the sidewalk to meet the boy, who stared at me as if I
was demented. I glanced down the outside—oh, there
it was. There was a throb of joy in my heart and a
rush of tears to my eyes. I hurried in and laid the
paper on father's lap.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" he ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
I went and mended the fire and stood there many
minutes, it seemed to me.
</p>

<p>
"Well, they didn't take us to kindle the fire with,
did they!" His tone was so light-hearted it was like
the ringing of a joy bell, and it gave me a thrill.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a foolish old fellow and you're a foolish young
thing, but I guess we enjoy this bit of print, and there's
no one to say we shan't. But there's been lots of books
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
and papers printed before we were thought of, and
there will be after we are gone, and I s'pose each fellow
will have a moment of pleasure, so why shouldn't
we enjoy ours?"
</p>

<p>
We did enjoy it to the full. It was so sensible, so
strong and practical, and full of a certain hope, assurance.
And what gave us a greater delight was these
few words on the inside, in the column of queries and
items.
</p>

<p>
"Will John Farmer please send his address to this
office? We commend his article heartily to our
readers."
</p>

<p>
"We won't shout it out on the housetops yet. Roofs
are too slippery to climb," and father laughed.
</p>

<p>
It was the best medicine he had for weeks. The sudden
interest in a new channel, taking him out of his
dreary waiting, strengthened heart and brain, if not
body. It was a new resource.
</p>

<p>
The inquiry was answered, and to our surprise
brought Mr. Wright himself. He spent a whole morning
with father, and had really known considerable
about father's work and success. He was a most delightful
man, and years afterward I appreciated him
and his work more truly than any unformed girl could
have done.
</p>

<p>
He asked father then to go on writing, to give his
experiences and advice. He, too, had boundless ambitions
for Chicago, and his was the larger insight for
education and broader movements.
</p>

<p>
His sympathy was very cheering as well. He put
new heart into father. And though less than a year
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
afterward he was compelled by the stress of other
matters, fully as important, to transfer the editorial
helm to the Reverend Ambrose Wight, one letter in the
name was not to make much difference. It was conducted
with the same untiring zeal for local advancement,
the same strong common sense and sterling
integrity. Father had a warm friendship with him
through a sorrowful time, and Ben Hayne found in
him a splendid practical adviser.
</p>

<p>
And so spring opened. Father had some crutches
and began to go out a little. But the streets were still
in a dreadful condition, though now strenuous efforts
were being made for some kind of pavements and sidewalks.
As many people had raised their sidewalks two
and three feet it was resolved to establish this grade.
New houses were being built. Homer was rushed
with business, and he wished Ben wasn't so booky.
As a firm they could make no end of money just now.
It was hard to find good workmen.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIV
<br />
A TURN IN THE LANE
</h2>

<p>
Poor father! My heart ached sorely for him. He
suffered with his hip, and his leg was useless. He was
still kept bandaged, and we hoped presently some improvement
would happen to the joint. It was bitterly
hard when he had been so active, so light of foot, so
full of energy and hope. If it had not been for his
writing now and then, I think he would have lost heart
entirely.
</p>

<p>
But something had to be done. He considered
several projects and discussed them with Dan, who
seemed to know a little of everything. An overseer—but
where could one find the right kind of man.
Renting the place on shares he objected to strenuously.
</p>

<p>
"If you could get about the overseer might do,"
commented Dan. "But you want some one up on the
good points of stock, of grain, of soil, of everything in
fact, or else some one willing to study your methods,
which have been a success. Well—I don't see how
you stand it. I should make the whole atmosphere of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
the town blue and sulphurous," laughing with hearty
good nature, yet with evident energy.
</p>

<p>
"Can you make one stalk of corn bear five ears? If
so swear," said father with a dubious half frown, half
smile. "I have found that even a horse well brought up
doesn't like to be sworn at. A mule may stand it. He
can kick back."
</p>

<p>
"Do you swear at Chita?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Chita!" What a wealth of tenderness there was in
the tone. "I'd about as quick strike her a blow, and
I'd deserve to be horsewhipped if I did either."
</p>

<p>
Dan was a handsome, manly fellow. Even of all that
came afterward I must admit it, though in this
hardly more than girlhood I was not considering individual
men. There were many in Chicago who were
tall and strong and vigorous. Father was only medium
size, and with no striking good looks, though he had
a trusty, honest, shrewd and rather humorous face. But
I loved him dearly. I could have gone to sleep in his
arms as I had on that long journey from Massachusetts
to Illinois, and now that he was unfortunate I
knew I should never leave him.
</p>

<p>
Dan's figure while large was supple in its quick
movements—lithe is the term, I suppose. He had the
most fascinating air of laziness and ease. I have seen
him throw himself on the grass with a grace that would
have moved a sculptor to envy, and the manner in
which he tossed his head back and laughed tempted
me to save up the funny little household incidents and
jests, and the quips I saw in the paper, just for the
sake of the merry ring. There was the boyish surrender
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
to fun, the delight in life that was really infectious.
As a little girl I had felt afraid of him, there
were moods now that made me tremble, there were
glances of his eyes so deep, so eager that I felt a helpless
captive with a wild, unavailing desire for flight.
Then always recurred to me the night of the wild ride
and how his arm had held me like a vice.
</p>

<p>
His hair was dark and fine and thick, with the ends
curling a little. In the winter he wore a beard, in the
summer shaved it off. He had a fine spirited nose, with
flexible nostrils that made me think of Chita, and a
beautiful upper lip, such as the old Latin poets gave to
their women. When I came to read them Dan used
to rise before me. He had a broad chin with a dimple
in it, which he really hated. "It was good enough for
a girl!" he would say disdainfully.
</p>

<p>
With all his kindness through the winter, I had
come to be very grateful, and we were delightful
friends, but on my part friends only. I could not
imagine Sophie or Nanette with such a husband. I
sometimes on Sunday interested myself curiously in
thinking which of the grown-up young ladies he would
marry. He called at the Doles quite often and took
out Miss Alleta, who would have made a very striking
Mrs. Dan Hayne. Then Martha Campbell was always
extremely cordial to him and rumor said she would
not be averse to more regular attentions. He was a
prosperous young fellow, and though his trades were
generally advantageous, no one ever accused him of
unfair dealing. I do not believe he would have cheated
any one out of a dollar, not from high principle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
but because he thought it mean, and meanness he
abhorred.
</p>

<p>
Out of all the talk father and Dan came to a business
arrangement. It was a great relief. Homer went over
to Mrs. Morrison's, and after a good deal of haggling,
bought the wheeling chair granny had used, so father
could get about by himself, for his arms were strong,
and there was an attachment at the side, lever-like, that
could be propelled by the occupant.
</p>

<p>
Looking back at this summer it was a happy one. I
was not much confined at home. Somehow I shifted
the care of father on Dan. I spent a day now and then
with Sophie, the baby was so utterly charming, beginning
to say little words that we understood perfectly.
Mother Hayne and Chris were also very pleasant.
Chris had joined the church in the winter and his inmost
desire was to be a clergyman. He had a really
beautiful voice. On Sundays I used to stop—there
were always some men in to see father—and sitting
out on the old porch, much renovated and rose grown
now, we used to sing the old Methodist hymns that I
can never hear without the tears coming into my eyes.

to the old tune of Greenville. There was still another:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The Lord into His garden comes,</p>
<p>The spices yield their sweet perfume,</p>
<p>The lilies grow and thrive——"</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Are there any new hymns now that bring heaven so
near?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hayne did not take cordially to the project.
He could understand Ben's ambition, and looked to see
him either a governor or a senator at middle life, but
ministers were not likely to make fortunes. Chris told
me his dreams, and not a few of them found lodgment
in his mother's heart.
</p>

<p>
As for Norman, his lot in life seemed to be settled.
Mr. Le Moyne was dependent upon him and loved him
like a son. When Ben confessed his ambitions to his
brother, Norman advised him to prepare for college and
enter Harvard, as that had an excellent law school as
well. He would send him two hundred dollars a year
until he was through.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that the loveliest and most generous thing in
the world!" and the tears stood in Ben's eyes when he
told me, beautiful brown eyes they were. "Norman's a
solid brick. I think I can get through in five years,
and this year to prepare. I should hate dreadfully to
leave dear old Chicago and all of you. But I could
come back in vacation if I thought it best."
</p>

<p>
"It's just splendid. And then Boston is—is so different,
and has so much in it"—and I paused, for my
ideas of Boston were extremely vague.
</p>

<p>
"And she wasn't so wonderful when she was only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
thirty years old. And now when you think of the canal
that gives us the key to the Mississippi, the Sault Ste.
Marie planned, the railroads that in a dozen years more
will be an accomplished fact—why, we shall be the centre
of everything."
</p>

<p>
We were enthusiastic, not mere braggarts. And the
years showed the wildest dreams were possible, though
so much of it had to be made by human hands.
</p>

<p>
"Six years. It is a long while to wait, isn't it?"
he continued musingly. "Then you will be——"
studying me intently.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be twenty-one. Oh, Ben, please don't think
of that," I entreated, for I could guess what was in his
mind.
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't be fair unless you cared very much.
Then, I think, it would be hard to have your lover so
far away and miss all the sweetness of courtship. You
see, I should be so engrossed I shouldn't have time for
society, and could not keep thinking of you. But I
don't believe you are really in love, Ruth. We are
more like brother and sister."
</p>

<p>
"That is it," I cried. "And I do not think I shall
marry at all, and that is why all you Hayne boys will
be so dear to me. For now you see father will need
me. I do not suppose he can ever be quite well again,
and he has come to depend on me for so many things.
And I shall try to be very happy."
</p>

<p>
"You are a darling!" He caught my hand and kissed
it. "And you see we can tell better then than now,
I shall hope it will come about some way, for I shall
never find any one I like as well as you."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Why, I shall be almost an old maid then," with an
hysterical sort of laugh, yet a pang for lost youth.
Girls in the new countries married young. "And I
may be queer——"
</p>

<p>
"You will never be anything but sweet to me, a dear
little girl, but it is best that you should be quite free.
If it was ten years and I came back I know I should
love you, for I should feel then that I had the supreme
right, that there was no one to dispute me."
</p>

<p>
Dear, brave, loyal Ben. Never girl or woman had a
truer friend.
</p>

<p>
It was by Mr. Wight's advice that Ben went to a
preparatory school that autumn, since he had fully decided
on his course, and we had no regular systematic
training for college then.
</p>

<p>
Everything went on well, only father did not improve
much. But his writing was a great delight to
him, and papers at a distance spoke of John Farmer's
trenchant articles, which pleased him immensely.
</p>

<p>
To be sure he and Dan did not always agree, but
they gave and took, and so seemed to get along pretty
well. I do not know what father would have done
without him.
</p>

<p>
It would not be possible to be brought into such
familiar contact with a man and not lapse into a certain
intimacy, I suppose, especially as he had charming
moods. He was so much older that I always thought
of his marrying some one eighteen or twenty, and of
the families of note. We sparred and jested, he praised
my cooking at times, he thought I had such pretty,
householdy ways, and that I loved father, which I did.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
When I went to Sophie's or Mrs. Hayne's he came for
me in the evening. And one picnic we had he took a
team and a big wagon, and had no end of fun giving
the girls, little and big, a drive. Miss Campbell was
really devoted to him that day.
</p>

<p>
Somehow, I thought of Polly Morrison, though Miss
Campbell did nothing pronounced, nor ordered Dan
about as Polly used to do.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Morrison had spent some months with her.
Polly was like a queen. Mr. Maseurier had no end of
slaves on his sugar plantation, and some were up
to the great house. Both sons were married, one settled
at New Orleans, the other in Vincennes. There
seemed a great deal of gayety at that place, and Kaskaskia
and Polly was in the midst of it.
</p>

<p>
Then there was a kind of all-day camp meeting in
the woods, and Chris and I had a very happy time.
Oh, the beautiful singing! I was almost impatient at
the addresses and the praying.
</p>

<p>
I had, too, this summer a pretty flower garden of
my own. Dan brought me some geraniums which I
had never seen before. I did delight in it, and I used
to keep the blossoms in the house. The first time I
had a bowl full father said, "That's like old times.
Your mother was so fond of flowers."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do tell me about mother," I cried, hanging over
the arm of his chair.
</p>

<p>
"There isn't much to tell, dear. We had three happy
years. We were young and poor, and very hard
worked. And one of the drawbacks to this prosperity
is that she is not here to share it."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
</p>

<p>
His voice fell to a tender solemnity, and I felt awed.
I shuddered at the thought of death.
</p>

<p>
Then Dan began to take me out driving. He had
another horse, but he seldom drove Chita except by herself
in a kind of sulky. Sam was larger, and one of
father's horses matched him. There was another odd
thing, he did not treat me so like a child, though he
was very sweet and less imperious. I liked him better,
but there was a mysterious feeling that I could not
explain. Still fifteen is generally not analytical, and in
those days the frank, free life had not made us introspective.
</p>

<p>
The crops had been fairly good. Father I found
had rather given up any hope of entire recovery, but
he was not despondent. We had drawn so much nearer
together, and I was taking such an interest in his
articles. I was getting to be quite a theoretic
farmer.
</p>

<p>
One autumn evening, it was raining very hard, a
perfect deluge. No one came in. In fact, the east
wind blew such a hurricane off the lake that a pedestrian
could hardly keep on his feet. We had a splendid
fire, and there was a box of geraniums in the window
full of scarlet bloom.
</p>

<p>
"Come and sit here," said father, motioning to the
arm of the chair.
</p>

<p>
It was broad, and he could use it for a writing desk.
It was a favorite seat of mine. I put my arm around
his neck and kissed him on the forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Little Girl," he began, "we love each other very
much. We have no near of kin, it is just you and I."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I made answer. "But there are all the
Haynes, and Sophie, and several of the girls that I
make believe are cousins."
</p>

<p>
He laughed. "And we must never separate, I think.
I couldn't live without you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father, no! no!" I cried, with passionate emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"But suppose in a year or two some man wants to
marry you, or rather that you fall in love. And—after
all, love is the best thing in a woman's life. You
see, the old people do not live forever."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father, you must not, shall not die! If you
did I should drown myself in the lake," and I put my
wet cheek down to his.
</p>

<p>
"There, dear. I am not thinking of dying. Indeed
this last month my hip has felt stronger, and I am
quite myself. But I am a good many years older than
you, and naturally would go first."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do not let us think of it. I cannot bear it," I
pleaded, with every pulse in a tumult.
</p>

<p>
"Under some circumstances I should like to see you
married. You were not in love with Homer, and some
one else was."
</p>

<p>
"And there has been Ben." Then I confessed that
episode, which he had not even mistrusted.
</p>

<p>
"The third time is fatal, I believe." There was a
half laughter in his eyes, yet a tender gravity as he
looked earnestly at me, and my cheeks burned.
</p>

<p>
"Do you care for Ben? Do you want to be engaged?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, no! I like Ben very much, but no, I do not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
want to marry him—ever," I said incoherently, but
with decision.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Little Girl. I cannot get along alone. If you
were five years older and a strong, robust woman I
might train you for an assistant. I have known women
at home who cared for a farm and reared a family of
children. But you are too young, and the conditions
here are too wild, too unformed, too severe. They
need a man's strength and resolution to grapple with
them. I have made a good start and am on the high
road to success, only now I cannot follow it up. I see
that, although I have fought against the conviction.
Either I must give up and step out, or have some one
to assist me who will take an interest, and whose interest
will be the same as mine."
</p>

<p>
"But will not Dan do it?" I inquired, innocently.
"You and he get on pretty well."
</p>

<p>
"He has proposed to on one condition. And that is—my
little girl."
</p>

<p>
His tone was low and he pressed me closer.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you don't mean—" I cried in a kind of terror.
"You can't mean—"
</p>

<p>
"He has asked me if I would object to his trying to
win you. There need be no hurry. He is a smart,
bright fellow with lots of energy and push, and it does
seem as if everything he takes hold of succeeds. In
this case we would go on together. Our interests
would be identical. We should both love you. I
shouldn't feel afraid then that you would be left without
a protector, if any untoward event happened to me.
But I am not going to urge you. I think he must care
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
for you, since there are other girls with much richer
fathers that I am sure would accept him for the asking.
You may think about it."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want to marry any one," I protested in
great tumult of soul.
</p>

<p>
"You are so young. Yet it is rather queer you have
not fancied any of these boys," and he gave a soft
chuckle, as if it rather amused him. "Their mother
cares so much for you, too. If I could be well again
we would snap our fingers at them all. But farming
needs the head to be able to get about here and there
and keep matters up sharp. Well, well, I suppose we
have to accept what comes," with a long sigh.
</p>

<p>
"It is very hard," I returned. "And yet you are so
well otherwise, and not old."
</p>

<p>
"No; if I were ten years older I would resign myself
to my fate without grumbling."
</p>

<p>
"But I do not want you any older."
</p>

<p>
"And you would be over twenty-five."
</p>

<p>
"A horrid old maid," I ejaculated. Single women
were not held in high esteem in those days. There
was a great need of wives, indeed many a first wife
died of overwork or over ambition, and more men than
women immigrated from the older States. Only the
very undesirable were left behind. Of course I should
be married sometime.
</p>

<p>
But it seemed strange to think of Dan Hayne as a
husband. He was so much older. He rightly belonged
to the girls of eighteen or twenty. But after I
was in bed, and I could not sleep readily, I thought of
the kind of son father needed. A man in store business
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
or a mechanic of any kind would be of little service to
him. Dan was buying and selling property and stock,
went round to the near-by settlements, was considered
a good judge of many things, and had friends on every
hand, though he was masterful and at times high
tempered. He was a gay young "buck" as they termed
it then, but marriage was supposed to settle a man.
</p>

<p>
The figure of Polly Morrison flashed up before me.
Why, I could not tell, for I had not thought of her
until she appeared like a strange, splendid vision.
There was a mocking light in her glittering eyes. Why
did she not forbid the bans? She only smiled in a sort
of triumph.
</p>

<p>
The next morning Nanette came for me to go shopping
with her, and though we had not a very extensive
array of stores, still we had a nice variety of goods.
Some of the older people thought there was too much
catering to the pride of life. We made one or two
calls, we chatted with the clerks we knew, and when I
reached home Dan was just going away. He and
father had been examining some business papers. We
merely spoke. I ran in the kitchen to hurry Jolette
about the dinner.
</p>

<p>
Chris came in the next morning. There was a wonderful
preacher from England who could give our
town but this one evening. Mrs. Hayne wanted me to
come over to supper and we would both go. "And I'll
see you home," said Chris, "if you can't stay all night."
</p>

<p>
I kissed father and went away. We had grown so
much more caressing since his hurt. There was
another neighbor in to tea. We started early and it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
was well we did, for before service time the church was
packed.
</p>

<p>
As I said, I liked the full, hearty singing. The
strange clergyman had a rather imposing presence. I
may as well confess that I was not particularly fond
of sermons, but after a little I became strangely interested
in this. There was the heroic self-sacrifice in it
that appeals strongly to youth, taking up the duty set
plainly before one and not making mean and shifty
evasions. But unless the sacrifice or the work had
some high purpose in view for God or the neighbor, it
was in vain and useless. We were to help in the daily
life that God gave us, to live out at our very best and
truest. Simply praying for our neighbor was not all,
when there was something to do.
</p>

<p>
I think I lost sight of the spiritual application. I
kept looking at a thing that seemed set before me to
do, and it grew clearer and clearer even if I did
shrink from it. I was to trust to the promise—"My
grace shall be sufficient." I was moved, exalted. I
can do the sermon no sort of justice, but every one for
weeks afterward talked of it, and Chris was most
enthusiastic.
</p>

<p>
When we came home father and Dan were playing
checkers, and they were both excellent players. Father
held up his finger and merely nodded to Chris, who
said good-night, for he knew how Dan hated to be
interrupted in a game. I came and stood by them.
This was the rubber, each had won one game. They
were almost at the last and so evenly balanced that it
seemed to me there was something more at stake
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
than a mere king row. A human soul was to be
crowned or—Is there such a determining power as
fate? If father won I should be free, if Dan, I should,
I must be his wife. I watched with strained eyes. Fingers
were hardly touched, then lifted. Father's forehead
seemed gathered in a knot, Dan's face was smiling
with that wonderful ease he had, the French call it
insouciance. Father moved—Dan's last man went into
the king row, and Dan smiled over at me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER XV
<br />
HOW MUCH WAS LOVE?
</h2>

<p>
We went on just the same for a week or two, friendly,
pleasant, but some influence I could not shake off drew
me nearer. Even now I suppose Dan was a fascinating
man, since girls yielded so readily to his sway and older
women made friends with him.
</p>

<p>
It was the full of the harvest moon, a magnificent,
glowing night. There were some corn-husking bees
to wind up with a dance in a new barn. There were
boats going out rowing, for the lake was like a sea of
glass. Dan really hated the water—I loved it dearly,
but the great lake was occasionally deceitful at its
blandest, and often a monster in its power to small
craft. The larger vessels were safe enough. Father
and I took a sail now and then, but Dan never went for
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth," he said this evening, "do you remember the
ride you once had on Chita? Come out and take another.
There may not be a night like this in a year
again."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I was such a little girl then. And we cannot
both ride her now," I protested.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" In the moon floods of light his eyes
transfixed me.
</p>

<p>
"Because I am so much larger. And you have grown
stouter."
</p>

<p>
He laughed. "See here," and catching me with one
hand he whirled me off the steps and clear around.
</p>

<p>
"You weigh about seventy-five pounds," gravely.
"If I asked Chita to carry seventy-five pounds of grain
and my stoutness she would go off like a bird."
</p>

<p>
"I weigh ninety-two," I returned with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"If it was ninety-four you would have to ride all the
same," in a determined tone. "Do you want anything
about you? But it is like a summer night. Come, I
told your father I was going to take you. Or would
you rather go to the dance?"
</p>

<p>
"Suppose I would?" I said saucily.
</p>

<p>
"We could go to the dance afterward."
</p>

<p>
For a week we had gone on as if nothing had happened.
But every day the duty had grown clearer to
me. Here was the son father needed. I could make
all of his life easier. He was the dearest person in the
world to me, and why should I not think of him first?
There seemed two sides to me, which there would not
have been if I had loved and understood truly what
marriage meant, that it was not all father's comfort and
interest.
</p>

<p>
"Come." He sprang on Chita. Then he made a
sudden decisive motion with his arm, and gathered me
up in front of him.
</p>

<p>
"I should have a pillion," I began complainingly.
</p>

<p>
"I want you here, just here, where I can see you and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
cannot lose you. If I did, your father would beat out
my brains with his crutch, and I would deserve it.
There, are you comfortable?"
</p>

<p>
He settled me and placed his arm tightly about me,
turning Chita with his right hand.
</p>

<p>
"I am very uncomfortable," I retorted petulantly.
</p>

<p>
"You won't mind it in a moment when we get out
of this beastly street."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't!" I tried to loosen his arm. "I can't get
my breath. I don't want to go."
</p>

<p>
"Will that do? I want you to be comfortable and
happy. Five different girls have asked me to the dance
to-night. Four of them would have been miserable if
I had confined my attentions to one, and the whole five
would have been indignant if I had distributed them impartially.
And you are ungrateful."
</p>

<p>
Something in his tone touched me. After a pause
he said, "And you have them all. Ruth, I want you
to love me with your whole soul and body. I want you
to marry me."
</p>

<p>
"There is Miss Campbell and Miss Conover. Think
how much finer looking they are. Oh, I can't think
why you should want to marry me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, queer as it may seem, and indifferent as you
are now, there are some other points. I want you.
I've resolved to win you, and shall do my best. And
your father needs my assistance, may for some time to
come. Can't we three pull together? You are not old
enough to have loved any one else, you don't know anything
about love, you little white blossom, so I shall
teach you. Your father has consented."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I felt as if a net was drawn around me. Did I want
to escape and leave father to suffer all sorts of anxieties?
Here was some one strong enough, willing
enough to shoulder them.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know—I don't know!"
</p>

<p>
"You don't love Ben," he declared fiercely. "It
would be folly to wait all those years."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, no," I cried.
</p>

<p>
"And mother had a half hope Homer would wait
for you. You see I know the family plans. Chris is
too young even for <i>you</i> to wait."
</p>

<p>
There <i>was</i> another. But it might be years before we
should see him. And he would have changed in all
that grand life. He was learning so much that we common
people would seem beneath him.
</p>

<p>
"Chita!" How tender the tone was!
</p>

<p>
At the word she was off, for we had left the crooked,
uneven streets behind us. What a night it was! You
could see the mountains of the moon traced out in
vague darkness, and the rest in glorious effulgence.
Some planets were visible, but she seemed to outshine
the starry crowd, and veil the blue of the sky in a silver
haze. Great far reaches of prairie like a sea, the stubble
holding a gem on every little twig. From somewhere
came a waft of wild grape, but it was so dry there was
very little dew. The crunch of Chita's hoofs made a
regular beat of music, but around all was a hush of
emptiness, a kind of mystery that allured yet filled one
with terror at its very solemnity, an atmosphere of
strange enchantment, as if one could ride on to another
world. Was I going on to a strange new world?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it splendid! I sometimes come out here alone,
in fact, though I've ridden children on Chita, I've never
taken one of the older girls out in this boundless solitude.
Chita and I keep our secrets together. What
do you suppose is beyond? Oh, must every one die
in the end and go to that strange country? Wouldn't
you hate to die, Little Girl? I want a long life of
pleasure and love, and business activities and money
making, and I wish I could never grow old. Why
can't one slough off the old body when it gets feeble,
and have a new vigorous one right here, with this
glorious life. What do we know about any other
world?"
</p>

<p>
I was transfixed by some subtle power. Indeed, I
hardly knew what he said half the time, I was so
penetrated by some strange influence. I thought I
would like to be in that other country and have no more
perplexities.
</p>

<p>
We turned at length, and for the first part went like
the wind. Was Chita a creature of steel nerves and
sinews? I caught Dan's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Are you afraid? Ruth, I wouldn't have any harm
come to you for my own life. And what is there about
you, slim little thing, only half awake to the real meanings
of life! But you will know them all some day, and
I shall be your teacher."
</p>

<p>
How exultant his tone was!
</p>

<p>
When we reached home father was in bed, tired and
lonely was all he would admit. Dan was very eager to
know if he could do anything, but father said no, he
had some bad twinges in his hip and back, and Jolette
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
had heated some flannels in whiskey and laid them on.
He would soon fall asleep and forget it.
</p>

<p>
"He was around a little too much to-day," said
Dan.
</p>

<p>
I went to the door with him and he almost crushed
me in his arms and kissed away my breath. I felt helpless
in this vehemence, yet I had to admit now that he
was my lover, would one day be my husband. Could
I be as glad and happy as most of the girls
were?
</p>

<p>
I went back to father's bedside. Oh, what should
I ever do without him. Yes, it was my duty to do
what I could for his comfort. That thought inspired
me. To prolong his life!
</p>

<p>
I was not altogether a meek sweetheart. There were
times when I feared and resented Dan's assumed
authority. Once I said, in some rather heated argument:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am not compelled to marry you. I might
say no, even when the minister asked me."
</p>

<p>
"You will love me so much by that time you will not
want to," and his laugh was tantalizing.
</p>

<p>
He took it for granted that I should love him even as
he desired. I would not have any one told, even his
mother, and I declared I was not engaged until I had
promised to marry him. I think now he liked the
secrecy. It did not make any outward change in my
life. I had a number of my young friends in on my
birthday. I was sixteen and we had a merry time.
Father brought out some of his best quips and told
some funny Yankee stories.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You'll have a better time without me," Dan said,
and I think <i>I</i> did. There was no need of self-consciousness
or embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
Father had a new plan that interested him strongly.
This was building a house for me, for us all, but it was
to be mine, farther away from the river, nearer the
lake and on higher ground. It was afterward to be
Washington Square. He had taken quite a plot of
ground there a year or so before he was hurt, in the
way of trade. We had a good deal of amusement
planning it. It was to be of brick, full two stories, but
with a peaked roof. He would have two rooms on the
lower floor, a sort of office and a sleeping-room. We
would have a real parlor, a dining-room—living-room
we called it then—and a commodious kitchen. There
was room for a vegetable garden, a hennery, and some
flowers. Pigs were at last debarred from the streets.
Father raised so many now that he had a separate enclosure.
Some people were trying to raise sheep
and making quite a success, only there were at times
forays of wolves, when every one turned out for
a wolf hunt.
</p>

<p>
The old house was to be built on and turned into
stores. Business was increasing on every side. The
terms of peace with Mexico were arranged early in the
new year. For the territory ceded we were to pay
fifteen millions. There were bitter arguments pro and
con. One party was resolutely against our having any
more land, we were large enough now, we had not
settled half the country we did own. The other side
pointed out the advantage the Louisiana purchase had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
been. Of course we needed the Mississippi River, but
this wild land, overrun with Mexicans and Indians,
would be more plague than profit.
</p>

<p>
Father was in favor of having all we could get.
</p>

<p>
The spring came early that year. We had discovered
in our county a fine bed of clay and were
making brick. All our lumber had to be brought from
a distance.
</p>

<p>
I liked the new situation very much, only it was so
far from the dear old friends. But it would be more
convenient for father, and he had faith that the city
would push up this way. We could see the lake, there
were so few houses between.
</p>

<p>
I said first I would not be married until I was in the
new house, but there were reasons why it seemed best
not to wait, and when people once began to suspect
Dan admitted the truth. We told his mother first of
all, and her joy really brought tears to my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I have always coveted you," she confessed, "though
I should have picked out any one of them sooner than
Dan, but I think he has about sowed all his wild oats,
and you and your father will be a sort of ballast. I used
to think you and Norman would make a match, but
he's so weaned away, and he never could content himself
here, I know. I expect to hear in every letter that
he has married a grand lady. I suppose you could
have waited for Ben, but that would have taken
years. Dan does love you."
</p>

<p>
I had never thought of marrying Norman, for when
I was old enough to speculate on such matters, I felt
he had gone to the higher round above me in education,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
accomplishments, and I was afraid he would
despise the crude, unhandsome town after the splendid
cities of the Old World. That was something out of
my reach, so I could love the old life with him in it like
a story where the incidents and characters were firmly
enwrought in one's mind.
</p>

<p>
Our courtship had been rather curious. At times
Dan's impetuousity swept me off my bearings and I
could do nothing but yield. I had a vague feeling it
was his overpowering domination, rather than anything
I wanted to give. There were moments when it
seemed as if I did not like love, and would fain run
anywhere to escape it. Since father was very well content
I would make myself so. And Mother Hayne
said laughingly—"Men get over this tremendous love
making after marriage and settle down into reasonable
beings."
</p>

<p>
Father said we would get all the furnishing stuff
when we were in the new house. We could tell better
what we wanted.
</p>

<p>
I wished I had the courage to be married in church
with the ceremony Sophie had. But I was not a
Catholic, and I should have had to fight for such a
thing. Dan wanted to be married quietly at home.
But I coaxed Mother Hayne over to my views, and we
settled upon the old Methodist Church.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be married there or not at all!" I said to Dan
decidedly.
</p>

<p>
So we were married in the new Methodist Church on
Washington Street, at noon, and I had three bridesmaids.
My gown was white Suisse with plenty of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
lace, and Dan gave a dinner at the hotel. It was very
merry and pleasant. Healths were proffered, good
wishes and kisses, for everybody kissed a bride then.
I think Dan glowered a little over this. He had to take
a good deal of chaffing and I was advised to "keep him
with a pretty tight rein and make him toe the mark."
There was the old joke of starting him out in the
morning to kindle the fire, and having him split the
kindlings and bring the water.
</p>

<p>
The infare was to be at our new house, and invitations
were scattered freely.
</p>

<p>
I wondered if there were any heart burnings among
the girls. I did not feel at all elated that I had captured
him. Rather he had captured me. I could say
honestly I had never made an effort.
</p>

<p>
Then we returned home to our little old house and
had to take a horrible serenade. Dan went out and
made a speech, gave the ringleader of the party some
money and quiet was restored.
</p>

<p>
A fortnight after that we moved. Dan's mother
gave him a feather bed and pillows, two heavy blankets
and two light ones and six teaspoons that had been
her mother's. She thought the oldest son ought to have
them, and a tablecloth that had been in her wedding
outfit.
</p>

<p>
The new house was very nice and comfortable, but
a modern bride would have rather disdained it. The
infare was a success. After that we were let to go our
way, for there were several other brides, Miss Campbell
being one, and she had married a promising young
lawyer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Father improved a good deal that summer. Jolette
had gone with us and there was a half-grown boy who
did chores, worked in the garden and went home
nights.
</p>

<p>
Before father had finished his stores he was offered
such an advantageous price for them that he sold and
reinvested in land farther out. Dan hardly considered
that wise.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody thought I was bit with the old Towner
place," and father laughed. "The city is going to
stretch out, and the lake shore is going to be valuable."
</p>

<p>
"Was I happy and in love?" Truly I could not tell.
I counted on the time when Dan's vehemence should be
toned down. He bought a pretty new horse, broken
for a lady's riding, and we used to have splendid gallops.
</p>

<p>
Norman Hayne was travelling in Prussia and Russia.
Ben entered Harvard. I think he did not altogether
approve my marriage, but I gave him good reasons for
it. Homer had a little son. Everybody seemed prosperous,
though there were troublous times about money.
</p>

<p>
The world was set ablaze then about the wonderful
discovery of gold in California, the dream of the old
Spanish explorers. Men rushed to the gold fields in
perfect armies. And now we felt as a nation there
was a great deal of grandeur in owning from ocean to
ocean. Marvels were told of the western coast.
</p>

<p>
I settled down into a housewifely body. Father said
now and then, "Oh, that is so like your mother."
</p>

<p>
He could not discard his crutches. He still kept up
his interest in the <i>Prairie Farmer</i>, and had begun to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
write other articles. The water works were occupying
a good deal of attention. The lead mines were inexhaustible.
Yet it took almost a week to get to New
York. The Illinois and Michigan canal was opened.
There were some brick buildings, and two aristocratic
blue limestone ones that were pointed out as curiosities,
having been built of stone that had been brought in
ballast from the lower lakes. Michigan Avenue that
was.
</p>

<p>
The Chicago River was being widened. Sidewalks
were laid as the streets were filled up. Old Chicago
was passing away, just as the Little Girl had vanished,
though father often used the name. Dan had given me
all sorts of pet names at first, then he settled down to
Ruth.
</p>

<p>
And so a year passed, two years. Dan was much
interested in city affairs, father was making money in
the old ways. We had settled down, and I supposed I
had all the happiness that comes to married life. No,
not all. There was no child to gladden our hearts and
draw us together. Homer had another little boy.
</p>

<p>
In the third year of our married life an incident happened
that, perhaps, was an entering wedge in the dissatisfaction
that came afterwards. One day father received
a letter from a cousin who had married another
cousin by the name of Gaynor. She had been left a
widow some years before. The homestead had been
willed to the eldest son, subject to her life-right in four
rooms one side of the hall, and her living from the farm.
The three daughters between had married, there was
one son, now sixteen, who did not get on at all well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
with his elder brother. He was a smart, bright boy,
with a fair education. Now, he was wild to go to
California, but she could not bear to think of the rough
life and the temptations, so she was emboldened to write
to her cousin, who she heard had done well in Chicago.
"Could he put John in the way of anything?"
</p>

<p>
There was an appeal to old memories that touched
me. Father so seldom mentioned his people.
</p>

<p>
"That's queer, isn't it?" he said, looking up with a
dry sort of smile. "John Gaynor! Why, I had forgotten
that I had a namesake."
</p>

<p>
"You might send for him," I suggested. "Sixteen.
And if he is a nice boy—why do you give that absent
sort of smile?"
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking. When I was a young fellow of
nineteen or so I fell headlong in love with a second
cousin, Sarah Parks. She was twenty-three. She reasoned
me mostly out of it, and I found she had a fancy
for an own cousin, Luther Gaynor. So she married him.
Then I went to the western part of the State, and when
I had managed to get a little together, married your
mother. She sent me a paper with a notice of her husband's
death, seven or eight years ago, and I wrote her
a letter. It is odd how the old things come back to
you. I recovered from my penchant for Sarah when
she settled into a regular common farmer's wife."
</p>

<p>
"Then first love isn't always the best or truest," I
said thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"That wasn't love, but a boyish fancy. I'm glad
to hear, though. I wonder what this young John Gaynor
is like?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Suppose you do send for him. If we shouldn't like
him—but you may find something for him to do. And
if he isn't worth anything you can pack him off home
again."
</p>

<p>
"You can plan clear to the end, Ruth," and he
laughed. "Well, we'll see."
</p>

<p>
Dan had gone to Galena, as he had some lead interests.
Mr. Bayne, from the <i>Farmer</i>, dropped in that
evening. After some newspaper talk he said:
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose you know any nice, likely boy,
Gaynor, that we could get in the office to learn
the trade. Ours is as slow as molasses in January,
and never can learn to set type. That Chris Hayne
would be fine, but he has his heart set upon being a
parson."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's queer!" Father looked at me and made
a funny face. "I have a namesake in Massachusetts
who wants to come West."
</p>

<p>
"Yankee boys are generally bright and good spellers.
You want one in a newspaper office. If he's worth his
salt we'll take him, and let him earn bread and butter
besides."
</p>

<p>
"John Gaynor. That's a good solid name," and
father's eyes twinkled mirthfully.
</p>

<p>
"If he takes after you he's just the fellow to come to
Chicago," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
Father nodded. "I guess I'll send."
</p>

<p>
"Do, do," was the eager response.
</p>

<p>
The very next day father Hayne was taken violently
ill. I went down there and found Sophie trying to
comfort mother. What should we do—send for Dan?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Wait until to-morrow and see what the doctor says,"
returned the anxious wife.
</p>

<p>
Two of the neighbors were in, and I felt I must go
home for the night, as I could be of no real assistance.
But I was deeply troubled.
</p>

<p>
The next day we sent a messenger for Dan.
</p>

<p>
It did not seem that a strong, hearty man could fail
so rapidly. But the disease was stronger, and in ten
days Homer Hayne took the last journey, and lay in
the best room, dead. Dan had come home in time, but
his father was delirious until he went into a stupor, not
knowing any one the last few days.
</p>

<p>
It was a dreadful shock to us all. Poor mother was
beside herself with grief. There was a very sympathetic
obituary notice in the papers. He had been a
good, upright citizen, if he had not filled a very high
place. And he had given the country five fine
sons.
</p>

<p>
"That of itself is a great thing," declared father.
</p>

<p>
Sophie took the poor widow home for a few days.
She was the tenderest of daughters. I would have
been glad to do it, but grandmother was so fond of the
children, we thought they would cheer her.
</p>

<p>
We wondered what she would like to do.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I must keep my own home," she said. "I have
Chris left."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," determined Dan. "That is best for the present.
Father did not make a will, but not one of us
would be mean enough to want to rob her of her home.
She worked for it as well as father."
</p>

<p>
I was glad to hear him say that.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gaynor had not answered the letter. There
had been such a sort of upheaval it had gone out of my
mind. So I was mightily surprised when I came home
one morning from some trading to see a young fellow
sitting on the porch with father, and hear him say:
</p>

<p>
"Ruth, this is John Gaynor."
</p>

<p>
A nice, wholesome youth, between boy and man, with
a fair, clean skin, rather light blue eyes, but with quite
deep eyelashes and brows, and light brown hair, not
with a decided golden tint, but giving the effect of
having gold dust sprinkled over it. Not especially
handsome, yet not plain, bright and intelligent.
</p>

<p>
He rose and shook hands with me. I liked him on
the spot.
</p>

<p>
"I see I have taken you by surprise. Cousin Gaynor's
letter was so cordial that mother thought I had
better start at once. I should get here about as soon
as an answer, as I have been explaining. I owe you a
thousand thanks for your welcome."
</p>

<p>
"The thanks are mostly due to father," I returned.
"I am very glad you have come. It is a pleasure to feel
that there is some one in the world really related to us.
Did you get here without any difficulty?"
</p>

<p>
"I did not have much, and I met with some entertaining
fellow travellers. Mother said I had a tongue
in my head and that I ought to have enough wit in my
brain to ask needful questions. What a wonderful
country it is! I am full of astonishment."
</p>

<p>
I smiled, the tone was so frank, one of those full
round tones that inspire confidence. But I had to excuse
myself and interview Jolette about the dinner.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When I returned he and father were in full tide
about relatives who had died, and who had married,
who had gone away, and about his own sisters,
married to farmers and interested in their own lives.
It seemed delightful, as if one was reading an entertaining
book.
</p>

<p>
Dan did not come home to dinner, he often took it
at the nearest hotel when he was busy. After father's
rest we had the carriage ordered up and took a drive
first along the shore of the magnificent lake, then over
in the prairies. There were acres and acres of corn
standing in ranks, their feathery golden helmets blowing
about, their uniform of richest green dazzling in
the sunlight. They looked so strong, so masterful,
almost as if they might start, and march you down
with human power. The boy was wild with enthusiasm.
It had an odd effect upon father. His
eyes brightened, the set lines in his face seemed
to fill out, he looked glad and happy, and it thrilled
me in every nerve. I did love him so in his misfortune.
</p>

<p>
It was quite late in the afternoon when Dan came
home. I had been arranging the supper table between
whiles looking after some choice cookery I did not
want to trust altogether to Jolette. He walked
straight in.
</p>

<p>
"Who's that on the stoop hobnobbing with your
father?" he asked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dan, it's a new John Gaynor from father's old
State, and it's so queer how it all came about," glancing
up eagerly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I began at the very beginning, the letter from Mrs.
Gaynor.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think I might have been informed of the
matter instead of having it kept a secret from me," he
exclaimed resentfully.
</p>

<p>
"But, Dan, you see you were at Galena, and then
your father was so ill and all that. It really went out
of my mind. Father supposed Mrs. Gaynor would
write again."
</p>

<p>
"Did your father send for that fellow?" His tone
was stern and there was an angry flash in his eye. It
roused resentment within me.
</p>

<p>
"He did," I answered bravely, but with some trepidation
of heart. Then I explained Mr. Bayne's call
that evening and the proffer of the situation.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I like that! To have some other people's
relations dumped upon you in this secret, underhand
fashion."
</p>

<p>
I stood up very straight and glanced in Dan's eyes.
"I suppose father has a right to ask a relative to his
own house," I said with dignity.
</p>

<p>
Dan flushed and his brow was one sharp frown.
</p>

<p>
"I thought the house was to be yours," he made
answer in a biting tone. "And I did suppose your
husband had some rights in it!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dan, don't let us quarrel about the house or
this young cousin or anything. Nothing must come
between our love for each other," I implored, throwing
my arms about his neck and kissing him. Then I
knew he had been drinking.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he felt ashamed. "I'm not quarrelling," he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
said gruffly. "But a man does hate to find that his
wife has kept secrets from him for weeks and weeks."
</p>

<p>
I had explained the whole matter and it was useless
to reiterate it. But I did say—"Young John Gaynor
needn't live here, you know."
</p>

<p>
He made no answer but went to his room to fix up
for supper.
</p>

<p>
I could feel that father was hurt and amazed by his
indifference at the table, which went almost to the
verge of rudeness. Afterward he took his hat and
marched out. I tried to make amends. I felt he would
not have acted so if he had been perfectly sober.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER XVI
<br />
HER RIVALS
</h2>

<p>
Of course we kept our guest all night. It was midnight
when Dan came home, and I pretended to be
asleep. But he was quite cheerful the next morning.
Chicago people were generally hospitable. There were
new families coming in almost penniless, one may
say, and they were helped upon their feet in the friendliest
manner. It had seemed to me that Dan had a
large and generous soul, but he did not show it now. I
felt heartbroken.
</p>

<p>
We were to go down to the newspaper office. John
thought he should like that above all things.
</p>

<p>
"I've never had half a chance at books," John said
laughingly. "I had about made up my mind to study
and get a district school. In a certain way I like farming,
but it's not so easy in our old State. Here it must
be splendid, inspiring! But a newspaper! That looks
like fairyland to me. Cousin Ruth, I'm like a girl about
fairy stories and King Arthur and Odin and all those
old heroes."
</p>

<p>
That sounded like Norman, and warmed my inmost
heart.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Fortunately we found Mr. Bayne and Mr. Wight
both in. I think they were quite taken with young
John. I wondered at his sort of aplomb for a country
lad. He was no braggart, but he did seem to have a
clear estimate of himself, and to most questions he said
so cheerfully—"I'd like to learn."
</p>

<p>
The upshot of it was that he was to come for a week
and try. Then Mr. Wight talked about Chris. Being
a clergyman himself, he was taking a fervent interest
in the lad.
</p>

<p>
We let father go home, and we took a walk about
old Fort Dearborn, and talked western history, which
interested him very much, as he had only the vaguest
idea about the West. In spite of last evening, I had a
light-hearted feeling, as if I was the Little Girl of the
past going about with Norman.
</p>

<p>
On our homeward way, just as I attempted to cross
the street, a carriage halted. There were two women
in it, and one leaned out calling to me laughingly—"Ruth
Gaynor—Ruth Hayne!"
</p>

<p>
I drew a long breath of utter amazement, and simply
stared. But for thin, pale Mrs. Morrison I certainly
should not have recognized Polly. She was a handsome
woman and dressed in the richest manner. She
seemed all of a glitter from her shining, rippling hair,
the bronze feathers blowing about her hat, the cloud of
lace around her neck with gold threads in it, and the
glistening silk gown. On her one bare hand shone a
circlet of diamonds, on her wrist a bracelet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," I ejaculated, drawing in a long breath of
surprise.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"If you had met me in a pudding pot you wouldn't
have known me," and she laughed with an amused
gayety. "<i>You</i> might get stirred up in the mush, but I
wouldn't, I'm too large."
</p>

<p>
"Polly Morrison," was all I could say.
</p>

<p>
"I came yesterday afternoon. This is my first visit
home, though I've trotted up and down the Mississippi
until I know every turn and every town. I have
a husband who hardly lets me out of his sight and he
has never found it convenient to come to Chicago.
Perhaps he is afraid he might see some other woman
he would like for a wife, he had such astonishing luck
before. And how Chicago has changed! All the old
houses have been built on to, and the stores and warehouses!
It can't hold a candle to New Orleans, and
Kaskaskia is a gay old town, but you're coming on.
Is this Chris?"
</p>

<p>
"No," and I explained.
</p>

<p>
"We're just out for a flyer. I took mother along
so that people would be the more likely to recognize
me. This afternoon we must go calling. I suppose I
ought to stay at home and let the neighbors call on me,
but I want to see them so. And poor Mrs. Hayne is a
widow. Ben gone off to college, is it? Homer getting
rich and peopling the town, but the other one is
abroad—married to some French marquise, I suppose,
and Chris going to be a minister. Lots of other
changes. There! You may look to see me some
day."
</p>

<p>
Her talk had been a swift dazzle, and made you feel
as if some one had whirled you around.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"What a talker," said John. "And what a handsome
woman. She looks fit to be a queen!"
</p>

<p>
We hurried home. I was anxious to have the dinner
all right, and I didn't exactly want Dan to see me coming
home with young John Gaynor. Why, I could not
explain altogether to myself.
</p>

<p>
Jolette was just dishing up when Dan entered. He
should not accuse me of secrecy this time.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dan," I cried, "did you see the new arrival,
not exactly in a coach and four, but in Harman's
barouche? Madame Maseurier and her mother viewing
the town."
</p>

<p>
"Polly Morrison!" he ejaculated. "How does she
look?" He was all interest.
</p>

<p>
"John thinks like a queen. She is wonderfully handsome,
or else it is the fine clothes."
</p>

<p>
"Come to show them off, I suppose. The old Frenchman
with her?"
</p>

<p>
"No. But she said her husband hardly let her out
of his sight."
</p>

<p>
"I'd trust Polly for squeezing out some dark night
if she wanted to." Then he gave his old, merry laugh,
and a good-humored nod.
</p>

<p>
The dinner passed pleasantly. John had a good deal
to say about the town.
</p>

<p>
Dan's strictures rankled in my mind. I really
wanted young John to live with us. I liked him so
much already, as one might regard a young brother,
indeed as I did Chris, only John belonged to me, to
father. But I did not want any trouble or jealousy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The lad went down to the office the next morning,
taking some lunch. Dan did not ask about him. He
came home very enthusiastic. He had struck just the
right thing, he was confident. And, grasping father's
hands, he said in his young, earnest voice, he could
never be thankful enough for that cordial letter of
his.
</p>

<p>
It was the third day later when father was resting
after having spent the morning in the fields, that I
took my sewing and sat beside him. Presently I said
tentatively:
</p>

<p>
"I am glad John has taken such a liking to the
printing office. What a cheerful, ambitious fellow he
is."
</p>

<p>
"A real Yankee!" Father laughed. "I like him
very much. It seems a whiff of my native air—of my
boyhood's air. Only I hadn't the ambition. The
world was not so ambitious. People had an idea in
those days that God had put you just where He
wanted you to be, and that it was a sin to try to get
elsewhere. They didn't read the Bible right in the
very beginning, 'Dominion over everything' is his
birthright."
</p>

<p>
After a pause I began in a kind of indifferent tone,
"Do you not think it would be a good thing for him
to board near the office, where he could run home to
his dinner? He is a growing lad, and a cold lunch
doesn't seem just the thing. Then in winter there
will be storms and awful going."
</p>

<p>
"We're not in winter now. What is to hinder him
from staying until then?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He looked suddenly, sharply at me. I felt the hot
blood rush to my face.
</p>

<p>
There was a silence. The fresh wind off the lake
sang its murmuring song, and the birds gave the
chorus, but I could feel the other hush.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, what's to hinder?" rather impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"I thought," then my voice faltered.
</p>

<p>
"Did Dan say anything? He doesn't like the boy's
coming, I can see that."
</p>

<p>
"He felt hurt because he had not known about it.
So many things happened just then——"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it was rather queer. He might have struck
something at home, and not come at all. I should
have felt like a fool making a great spread about it.
I did suppose his mother would write again. But I
don't care now. And the house isn't Dan Hayne's!
There's our bargain in black and white. To be sure,
I haven't deeded it to you. I started to once, when
Hamilton made a suggestion——"
</p>

<p>
"We have been so happy and peaceable."
</p>

<p>
"Ruth," his voice was low, and with an inexpressible
longing, "I wish you had a child or children."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father, it has been the one desire of my heart,
my trial, my constant prayer," and I leaned my face
down on his arm and cried softly.
</p>

<p>
Sophie had twin boys besides her other son and
daughter. Dan envied the twins with the longing of
fatherhood. This matter had been a sorrowful disappointment
to us both.
</p>

<p>
"There, dear," said father presently. "There may
be some wise purpose in it that we can't see now. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
I don't say, like David, in his prosperity, "I shall never
be removed. Thou, Lord, hast made my hill so
strong." I think quite often of the time when I <i>shall</i>
be removed. I'd like to know that some one of my
blood would take a delight in these broad prairies and
fertile fields. It seems queer when luck went against
me in my early life that I should have so much of it
now when I am an old lamenter. Of course, Dan is
an excellent manager, it's born in him, but I keep
things up sharp as well. This was what Hamilton
said: 'If your daughter dies without children you know
this goes to Mr. Hayne. Have you no relative that
you would like to succeed her?' I stopped short then.
You see Dan might marry again, and your property go
to another woman's children."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't mind Dan, but another woman and her
children—oh, I couldn't bear to think of their living
in this house—the children I have been denied," and
I could not stifle my sobs.
</p>

<p>
"Little Girl, you may outlive Dan. Think how his
father went, who had never had a day's illness in his
life before. But one needs to consider all the points.
So I have been thinking this last year if there was
any one I would like to have succeed us, or if I should
leave it to found a hospital, which we shall need. I
couldn't make up my mind. I thought we would talk
it over some day. And now John has come in a sort
of miraculous way. We do not know how he will
turn out in the end—but I like the name—John
Gaynor. Would you mind if he came after
us?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I should like it. Already he seems like a
brother."
</p>

<p>
"That is, if there should be no children. We needn't
give up hope," and he smiled tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I should like him to come after us," I said
after some moments of thought.
</p>

<p>
"Meanwhile, if I want to help him out of my part
of the profits, you will not feel sore?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, no," I returned earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I want him to make his own way, it gives
a young fellow more reliance on himself. But he
might as well live here——"
</p>

<p>
I was cut to the heart with a curious presentiment.
Dan would be jealous, I knew by what he said that first
night. If it had been altogether the drink he would
have met the boy cordially afterward. But he had not.
I had never thought of Dan caring especially for
father's property, yet I wondered now if he would have
wanted to marry me if there had been only a trifle.
As I grew older I could not understand why he had
been so persistent, when I had not really "fallen in
love with him," as the phrase goes. I might have been
mortified if he had given me up at last, but I knew
now I should not have been heartbroken. I had tried
my utmost to yield him all wifely love. Sometimes
he was fierce in his vehemence, and it turned me cold
at heart. I liked the gentler moods best, but occasionally
there was a hard indifference. If there had only
been a child to give scope to the fatherly feeling!
After that I think I would only have been the mother
of his child.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was nothing to do but to tell father the truth.
He was quite angry at first, but he loved me too well
to risk my happiness, so he consented reluctantly.
But John should come as a visitor and be made welcome.
</p>

<p>
"And whatever you want to do for him you must
do without thinking it will take aught away from
me," I said firmly. "It is all yours, and I want you to
be happy."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I had never persuaded you to marry Dan
Hayne," he subjoined in a profoundly reflective manner.
"But I was truly afraid then that I should die,
and he did seem to love you."
</p>

<p>
"And he loves me now," I returned bravely, but
with a curious sinking of heart.
</p>

<p>
It took more than one talk to get matters settled and
father was loth to let John go. But I knew how necessary
it was when Dan said with an acrid sound in his
voice—"Is that fellow going to hang round here all
the time?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I replied cheerfully. "He is to board with
Mrs. Wilson down on Lake Street. It will be so much
more convenient when he is once fairly at work. He
has decided to learn the printing business."
</p>

<p>
I knew he looked sharply at me, and I hated to have
anything to hide from him.
</p>

<p>
I went over to Mrs. Wilson's and selected his room,
seeing that it was comfortably bedded and furnished.
Then I paid her a month's board in advance, explaining
the relationship to father and saying that he was
warmly interested in his namesake's welfare. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
promised to see that he was well taken care of in every
way.
</p>

<p>
He hated to go, declaring he did not mind the walk
nor the early rising it entailed. But we set it out so
very much to his advantage that he ceased to
object.
</p>

<p>
"And we shall look for you on Sundays and whenever
you like of an evening. We shall keep a sharp
watch over you and see that you do not go astray."
</p>

<p>
"I should be a beast if I did after all your kindness,"
he returned with deep feeling.
</p>

<p>
I was rather glad that Polly Morrison, as people
still called her, made a diversion through this time,
when relations were strained. It was quite an event
for the town. Madame Maseurier was somebody in
her silks and furbelows. She was not "dined and
wined," though no doubt the gentlemen would have
done it if it had been admissible, but tea drinkings, the
complimentary honor of that day, were proffered.
</p>

<p>
"Dan," I said, and I tried to keep in my usual mood,
even if he was captious, "Dan, Mrs. Gurnee has asked
us to supper to meet Madame Maseurier to-morrow
evening."
</p>

<p>
"Well—" rather sharply.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't care to go I will send regrets."
</p>

<p>
"Who said I didn't care to go? Can't a man think
a moment if he has anything to prevent?"
</p>

<p>
I made no comment.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want to go?" in a curious tone.
</p>

<p>
"It is always pleasant at Mrs. Gurnee's, and her tea
is delicious. It must come straight from China."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is no doubt part in the brewing. Well," with
a nod of the head, "we'll go and inspect the Madame
in her fine array. I hope you have something decent
to wear."
</p>

<p>
Fortunately I had a silk gown made in the latest
style. The skirts were very full, and mine, because I
was very slim, had to be laid in plaits underneath the
gauging.
</p>

<p>
Certainly Polly was a fine-looking woman and distinguished
in manner, in spite of her madcap youth.
Several of her old admirers were present as husbands,
and she distributed her smiles impartially. She
seemed to have a very ready wit and much intelligence,
and really was fit to grace a court.
</p>

<p>
The next night but one we met her again. She
was very charming and brilliant.
</p>

<p>
"I hear you have a fine new house," she said to Dan.
"Am I to have a chance to view it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing to your fifty or hundred year old
houses with all their treasures. Chicago, you will remember,
is new, and the world has not yet poured its
luxuries into our laps. I had an idea you had given it
a long last farewell."
</p>

<p>
She laughed softly. "That is to say you decline—and
an old friend! I did not think you so cruel."
</p>

<p>
He flushed. "No, I should feel quite honored," he
subjoined quickly. "Ruth, is there an evening you and
Madame Maseurier can agree for her to come to us?"
</p>

<p>
I really wanted father to see her, so I accepted the
opportunity readily, for I had hardly dared propose it
to Dan, and she agreed with charming suavity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You can hardly make Polly Morrison out of her,"
I remarked as we were walking home.
</p>

<p>
"She has been polished up by society, we must admit,
and she is what I call a handsome woman. Those tall
women always do have such a queenly look. It pays a
man to get them fine clothes."
</p>

<p>
And I was barely medium.
</p>

<p>
I did my best to have a pretty tea table. Dan said
not to ask any one else. We had made some vines
grow over our porch, and I had a row of flowers on
each side of the walk, like my mother's dooryard.
Polly admired it cordially and told us of the southern
flowers and vines that grew so riotously in their sweetness
and bloom. She sat and talked to father until
they were summoned to tea, and we had a rather merry
meal. She thought our prospect so fine, the great
sweep of prairie on one side, the lake on the other.
They laughed about old Chicago, though Polly
said it had not made rapid strides only in a business
way.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes gave one the queerest feeling, as if they
really absorbed you, drained you of some power, and
yet you were lured to meet them again and again.
</p>

<p>
Dan proposed to take her home in the buggy.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, let us walk," she returned. "I am afraid of
these uneven narrow lanes at night, when you can't see
the pitfalls."
</p>

<p>
So they went off together, she with a lace scarf over
her shining, rippling hair, southern fashion.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of her, father?" I asked, as we
settled ourselves on the porch.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"She is out of the ordinary, a woman to take a man
straight to the devil if she so elected. I don't wonder
her husband keeps a good watch over her, but she
seems to accept it gayly. I do not believe she has any
heart."
</p>

<p>
Dan did not return until midnight. At first when he
was out late I used to keep awake until I found it
annoyed him. Now I went to sleep if I could, or pretended.
</p>

<p>
Two or three days after that Polly returned home.
</p>

<p>
John trudged over when he had been at his boarding
place three days. It was as nice as it could be, but
wasn't like this, and the street was wretched down that
end. Yes, the meals were very good, and the office
work was easy enough. Mr. Bayne had asked him
to come in some evening, he had quite a library.
He had written everything to his mother, a long,
long letter, and she would be so amazed, so delighted.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I might call you Uncle John," he said in his
frank, free way. "It seems to bring you into the
proper relation—there's so much difference between
us in years. Oh, at the office they think you know such
a lot!"
</p>

<p>
"I've had a chance to learn a good deal in the years
I've lived. Any one can who keeps his eyes open and
adds two and five together."
</p>

<p>
"But why two and five?"
</p>

<p>
"Because it takes you farther along than two and
two. Sometimes when you go out of bounds you
strike a new knowledge."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Sunday morning Dan went off with one of the
packers to look at a drove of cattle, and we had a delightful
time with John all day. He told us about his
sisters and their families. One of the husbands taught
school in the winter. His own brother seemed a
rather close-fisted sort of person, and his mother now
and then went out nursing. But there was no chance
for a young fellow in the town unless he had a farm
to start with.
</p>

<p>
Dan seemed to settle into a sort of tolerant mood
toward young John, but though I tried my best I
often found him sharp and captious. Then he would
have a spell of being tigerishly fond of me. I cannot
use any other adjective, and it filled me with terror,
as it had times before, as if he sought to impress upon
me that I was his alone.
</p>

<p>
Then we heard that Mr. Pierre Maseurier had been
thrown from his horse and picked up with a broken
neck.
</p>

<p>
Everybody wondered what Polly would do. Her
mother went to her.
</p>

<p>
So the winter came on again. Half a century had
passed. It was 1850. How queer it seemed, as if we
had written 1840 all our lives. And I was twenty
years old.
</p>

<p>
Ben was in Harvard. Mr. Wight planned for
Chris to study Latin and Greek, and go to a preparatory
school another year.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Morrison and Polly came home. It seems that
Mr. Maseurier had made no will, and the sons claimed
everything. Wives were not well provided for at that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
period. Still, the sons gave her a small portion of
their wealth, and she returned to Chicago, her luxurious
life at an end. I wondered if she was very sorry.
She wore heavy widow's mourning, and did not look
as attractive as in all her furbelows. Then widows
were expected to live very quiet, retired lives for six
months at least.
</p>

<p>
I was rather surprised when Dan inquired somewhat
brusquely one day if father had given me the
deed of the house.
</p>

<p>
"Is it worth while before I am twenty-one?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
"What a silly idea! It is worth while any time.
Ask him to do it. He promised to."
</p>

<p>
I spoke to father.
</p>

<p>
He went over to Judge Manierre and had the deed
made out. The house and the three acres of ground,
barn, outbuildings, etc., were mine, and to go to the
heirs of my own body, failing in that they were to
revert to the original estate of John Gaynor. Then
he made his will. Everything was left to me during
my lifetime with the exception of a few gifts of land,
a plot to Dan Hayne, another to the son of his cousin,
John Gaynor. At my death without lawful heirs it
was all to go to John Gaynor. There were several
permissions given about selling under certain circumstances.
And if John Gaynor died without heirs the
estate was to go to the city of Chicago to found a
hospital.
</p>

<p>
He brought a copy home to see if I was satisfied
with it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I said I was entirely. If I died, why should father's
fortune go to enrich one who would soon forget me?
</p>

<p>
For now I had an awesome consciousness that my
husband did not love me as Homer loved Sophie, as
many wives were loved. I tried to be sweet and
patient, to keep my house in pretty order, to have his
clothes just as he wanted them, and everything to his
hand, to be ready if he asked me to go out, which he
did not often do nowadays. He was a good deal with
the men. He had been training Chita's pretty colt for
a splendid racer and was proud enough of him. Then
he was off to Galena for a week at a time, or on some
other business over night.
</p>

<p>
When he learned about the house he was very
angry. I had never seen him in such a passion. It
turned me sick and cold. He had never sworn at me
before, and he said dreadful things about father.
</p>

<p>
"It is all father's," I replied. "He gives it to me
during my lifetime if I outlive him, and while he lives
no one can take it away from him."
</p>

<p>
"He promised you the house. It was an object for
me to marry you."
</p>

<p>
"Then you did not love me?" I faced him with that.
</p>

<p>
"Well, in a way, yes. But you are poor, barren
stock! And here comes this beggar's brat that no
one ever heard of before—why, I thought you had no
relations. And he is to take everything."
</p>

<p>
"I may live to be an old woman. And father may
live years yet."
</p>

<p>
He had certainly seemed stronger the past year.
He had attended to nearly all the planting in the spring,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
Dan had been away so much. He got about very well
with only one crutch.
</p>

<p>
Dan swore a horrible oath and turned on his heel.
I was glad father was not in the house, but I was
mortally afraid he would go after him. He was away
then for two or three days and nights. There are
some shocks that seem to change life for us, make a
difference that one can never wholly surmount. I
knew this had come to me.
</p>

<p>
Dan was not covetous. He made money easily, and
spent it freely without any apparent regret. There
were suppers with the men, and he was generous about
helping his friends. So why should he have counted
on father's money when he could be a rich man with a
little carefulness?
</p>

<p>
But the awful knowledge that was more than suspicion
rushed over me, leaving me cold and faint.
Father <i>had</i> been poorly that winter. And I knew now
if father's land should be turned into money, if the
city should go on spreading out, I would be an heiress.
Dan had as much faith in Chicago's future as
father.
</p>

<p>
Had this anything to do with his fancy for me?
I could not blind myself to the fact. Then I think I
had piqued him by not being too easily won. It was
not coquetry, but because I had never felt certain of
myself.
</p>

<p>
I was so miserable I had to tell father.
</p>

<p>
"My poor Little Girl!" Then he roused to anger.
"I can easily destroy the deed. The bargain was that
I should deed the house to you, but that I should have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
my home in it as long as I lived. I never promised to
will all my property to you. For a certain amount of
oversight he was to have a certain share of the profits.
This last year he has not done his part at all. I could
justly complain of him. I have hired some of his work
done out of my part. He is with a gay set and he
does drink. Oh, my Little Girl, you are between two
fires."
</p>

<p>
He took me in his arms, and I cried on the dear
fatherly breast.
</p>

<p>
It is curious how the expected fails to meet the
mark. Father had resolved to brave it out, and I was
shaking in every pulse. But Dan returned careless
and pleasant, ate his supper with rather exuberant
gossip, dressed himself, and went out with no sign of
storm, and we would not throw the first dart.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth," Sophie began hesitatingly one morning
when I had gone in to see the babies, which were my
delight, "what calls Dan down to the Morrisons' so
much? He is there every few nights. And he took
Polly out driving after nine o'clock. Some one ought
to put a stop to it. Polly is being very retired and
discreet, and all that, but this is going on."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?" I asked, cold as ice at heart.
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell you without a breach of confidence, that
is, not the name. But it is true. Shall Homer take
it up?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, no," I cried. "Don't let him quarrel about
me. I can't tell. Wait and let me think."
</p>

<p>
"It will be an open scandal by and by, though they
carry it on in the dark. Somehow I always rather
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
distrusted Dan. Oh, you ought not have married
him."
</p>

<p>
But it was all done. No one can take a step backward
in his or her life. I remembered what father
had said about Polly.
</p>

<p>
I rose weak and trembling. I said again I must
think it over. She kissed me tenderly, but I was like
one bereft of feeling.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVII
<br />
POLLY.
</h2>

<p>
I thought when I was out in the street I would go and
see Mother Hayne. I would like to know how this
matter of the house seemed to a woman who had been a
wife many years. Yet her husband had not taken pains
to make any special provision for her. Why should a
wife then provide for her husband? I felt ill and perplexed.
</p>

<p>
Her face was radiant. She clasped me in her arms
and kissed me again and again.
</p>

<p>
"Do people ever go crazy with joy?" she cried, and
there was the wonderful sound in her voice that comes
from a full heart, satisfied to the utmost. "I've read
this letter over and over again. Norman is coming
home!"
</p>

<p>
Was he going to bring a wife? I wondered in a
dull manner, but I uttered no word.
</p>

<p>
"You must read it. I can't begin to tell you. Norman
has won his good fortune, for I know he has been
the best of sons to that poor old man. And now he
comes back to us. Read! read!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
</p>

<p>
She thrust the letter into my hand and sat down,
wiping the tears from her face with her apron, smiling
through them, her face fairly transfigured and looking
almost like a girl. I stared at her, the transformation
was so wonderful.
</p>

<p>
"Read! read!" she cried impatiently.
</p>

<p>
In the previous letter he had written to his mother
he had spoken of a rather severe illness that had
attacked Mr. Le Moyne. It had not made any special
impression on me. But here in the very beginning—and
they had gone to one of the pretty coast watering
places where, though he was quite feeble, he seemed
to recuperate. No one had felt especially alarmed
when he had a slight recurrence, and for a few days
he had seemed not to lose ground. Then there had occurred
a sudden collapse of all the vital energies and
in twenty-four hours he had passed away. But he had
kept some sight to the last. It had been a horror to
him lest he might have to be led about, and he had
prayed to go before that time. And though Norman
would miss one who had been the kindest of friends,
indeed a father to him, he had lived out the allotted
span, and had his wish granted.
</p>

<p>
Part of the letter had been written while they were
making arrangements to go to Paris. His family slept
in Père la Chaise, and he would be laid beside them.
There was much in the tender regard and sorrow that
brought tears to my own eyes.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at Paris he had found a great deal to do.
Mr. Le Moyne's papers were in the safe of a notary.
All the arrangements had been made to a letter. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
had left quite a large fortune. There were some distant
relatives remembered, he had been generous to the oculist
who had prolonged his failing sight, to his numerous
friends, doubly generous to him, Norman, and
the residue had gone to charity. As soon as he could
get through with his part of the business he should fly
home at once, though the probabilities were that he
would have to go back again. But he was dying for a
sight of the dear ones, especially his mother in her
sorrow.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed a heart-appealing letter. We both
cried over it, yet it gave us a great sense of joy. I forgot
my own troubles entirely, and though she was fain
to keep me I hurried off home. They were just sitting
down to dinner.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dan," I cried, "your mother has heard such
news. Mr. Le Moyne is dead and Norman is coming
home. He has been left quite a fortune. She wants
you to come down and read the letter."
</p>

<p>
"Hello! That <i>is</i> news. And a fortune! The
Haynes are looking up. Well, I suppose Norman is
so Frenchified and full of airs that he will give Chicago
the go-by. No word of his marrying? Mother
doesn't seem to accumulate daughters-in-law very
fast."
</p>

<p>
Father was interested as well. When Dan rose to go
he said pleasantly, with what sounded like desire in his
voice—
</p>

<p>
"Ruth, don't you want to go out for a drive this
afternoon? There's such a fine breeze and the sun
isn't over hot."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Was there really a smile on his face? My heart
leaped up in gladness and I answered joyfully.
</p>

<p>
Father and I talked quite a while afterward. He
was glad to see Dan so cordial. I could not tell him
what I had heard. And yet might it not have been
mere gossip?
</p>

<p>
He had made several ill-natured flings about the
house, but no real complaint again. I do not suppose
he knew about the will. I was glad and thankful to
have him pleasant, and to ask me to go out with
him.
</p>

<p>
And yet as I sat there waiting, so as not to detain
him, my heart went down again and I questioned his
motive, feeling that it was terrible for a wife to do that.
How had I lost faith? How had I come to have this
mysterious outlook so dark and full of fear?
</p>

<p>
He was bright and smiling when he came. It was
a perfect summer afternoon and the air was fragrant
with the growing crops, beautiful and peaceful too.
A golden light hovered over all, making subtle waves
in the air, and then followed the rose-colored suggestion
of coming sunset, as if to herald the brighter glow.
Dan had been very pleasant, jolly, finding so many
amusing incidents. To me there was a sort of sweetening
of perceptions, a sense down deep in my consciousness
that matters would go better. What if he
had taken Polly out to ride one night, what if he had
called there occasionally? I was his wife, and if he had
been vexed about things he <i>must</i> love me, since we were
to go on to our life's end. And no matter how hard
it was, I <i>must</i> love him. It seemed as if I had never
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
known how high and solemn a thing love was until
now.
</p>

<p>
When Dan lifted me out of the buggy he kissed me
and said, "Have you had a nice time, Little Girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dan!" I hugged his arm. There didn't seem
any word in my vocabulary strong enough to express
my satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
I remember he played checkers that night with
father, losing the first game, winning the second, but
father captured the rubber.
</p>

<p>
"I'm getting rusty," he laughed. "I must brush up.
Now let us have a game of cards."
</p>

<p>
There were several new games. I took a hand with
them. When Dan went out to see if Chita and Duke
were all right, father said:
</p>

<p>
"Dan hasn't been drinking for several days. If he
could realize how much more of a man he is when he
lets whiskey pretty well alone, I think he'd drop it.
It was quite like old times to-night, wasn't it, Little
Girl?"
</p>

<p>
My heart was so full that I could only kiss father.
Both of them had called me "Little Girl."
</p>

<p>
I was so comfortable that I dismissed all thoughts
of Polly. Indeed, Norman's return was the great
theme of conversation, and most people were speculating
on how much of a fortune he would have. Mr.
Harris had dropped into quite an old man and his hair
was snowy white. He took great credit to himself for
starting Norman on the road, as he phrased it, and
talked over all the early times with father. Oh, how
fascinating they were!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I had given up corresponding with Norman, given
up my French also. I had written several times after
my marriage, but I must confess Norman's letters had
lost something of their charm. He used to say, "Do
you remember this or that, the walk we took here, the
talk about such a poem or such a legend?" He had left
off all these references.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you have to write to Norman?" Dan said
on one occasion. "Can't you hear all the news from
mother? And I should think the letters must be mostly
repetitions."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I don't <i>have</i> to," I said laughingly.
</p>

<p>
Then I began to send messages in his mother's
letters. She used to write them in journal fashion,
and it was quite a labor. Once she said, "I do grudge
postage for such clumsy packets, or I should if Norman
didn't send it every now and then, twice more
than I can use." It was very sweet of him.
</p>

<p>
Every day I thought of his return. He was twenty-nine
now. How would he look? not like Homer—I
wanted him to have his own individuality.
</p>

<p>
We went on very comfortably. Dan looked after
business better, though he made some trips away—two
or three days at a time. I said to Sophie, "I think that
about Polly was awful gossip. Dan does stay at home
a good deal."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head dubiously. "It came very
straight to me. But Polly has been away some latterly.
I suppose we will presently see her blossoming out of
widow's weeds, and she'll capture some one with
money again. You mark my words."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was one point Dan did not try to overcome.
He did not, would not, like young John, who was doing
well and a favorite with his employers. He remarked
it.
</p>

<p>
"Cousin Ruth," he asked, one of the Sundays he was
specially invited, which meant that Dan would not be
at home, "why does Mr. Hayne dislike me so? I don't
do anything to him. Is it because your father does a
little in a money way for me? I mean to pay it all
back as I get along. And the house is uncle's, I suppose?
I'm not going to ask anything outright. You've
both been so kind, and sometimes I feel as if I rather
sneaked in, don't you know," and there was a perplexed
light in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" I returned decidedly. "He used to be
curt to his own brother Ben at times. Men who have
to order others about and swear at cattle and all that
get brusque ways."
</p>

<p>
"You see <i>my</i> brother didn't like to have me round,
why I never could quite tell, unless he thought mother
was taking a double share out of the farm, and I
worked like a trooper out of school hours. I've seen
just the same look in Mr. Hayne's eyes."
</p>

<p>
"You come for father's sake," I made answer.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I had some misgivings. I seemed to
be leading a double life. I was smoothing out the
thorns and crookedness between father and Dan, I
was having this pleasant young fellow on the sly.
Sometimes I had a strong mind to ask father to change
the deed of the house and let Dan have it when I died.
But on the other hand, Dan was spending money freely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269' href='#Page_269'>269</a></span>
everywhere. He did bet on games and cards, and on
the Indian races. He gave a supper to the men occasionally.
Of course, he always won on Chita, perhaps
on other risks. He was very free handed.
</p>

<p>
Father had so few wants, and no extravagances.
Surely he had the right to spend a little on his own
kin.
</p>

<p>
Oh, how I did want a friend in these days. I wished
at times that I was a Catholic and could go to confession.
Père Saint Palais was so lovely, and his
voice had that beguiling winsomeness that I longed to
have it comfort me, set me straight. For I was beginning
to feel there was a great hard wall between
Dan and me. I tried my best to love him. Oh, what
was love!
</p>

<p>
Yet, some of the wives I knew had fallen into a
settled routine, I was going to say indifference. They
kept their houses well, looked after their babies. Their
husbands went out in the evenings to smoke or talk
politics, trade, crops, and they ran into a neighbor's to
gossip. Why could not these things satisfy me?
There were sudden impulses that led me to kiss Dan,
to almost beg that he would love me as he had in those
first few years, when I did not really want it. Perhaps
I had tired out his love. Mother was sure married
people "settled."
</p>

<p>
I knew father was watching me very closely. I tried
to hide my thoughts with a girlish gayety. It occurred
to me more than once that I might have to
choose between Dan and father, and in my secret heart
I knew I should go with father.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270' href='#Page_270'>270</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Polly was beginning to crawl out of her seclusion a
little. I met her one day at the bookstore where I
was buying some articles for father. I could not
understand why she should color up so. She really
did look enchanting with the bit of lisse roll to her
widow's cap inside the bonnet, often called Marie
Stuart. She had a "book muslin" collar worked
with black and little turn-over cuffs of the same
material. Her white skin and her wavy hair, her
full red lips with their tempting curves almost fascinated
me. Did Dan ever kiss her? I wondered.
Could she take a man "straight to the devil?" I shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"You don't look well," she began in her mellifluous
tones. "You are thin and pale. Do you know I used
to think you were quite a pretty little girl, but I suppose
we all do go off some," laughing. "I tell mother
I never want to be a horrid-looking old woman like
granny. Wasn't she frightful? So I hope I'll die
somewhere along middle life, when I can make a decent-looking
corpse. And Norman's coming home! Don't
you suppose if Norman had stayed here you would
have married him instead of Dan?"
</p>

<p>
"I think Dan made me marry him," I gasped, as if
the words were wrested from me.
</p>

<p>
"He's awfully imperious, isn't he? I suppose you
give in to his whims, but the way to keep your charm
over such a man is to deny him, to dispute with him—up-and-down
quarrels, and the making up is delicious!
Marriage is queer, isn't it, and the wrong people do get
together! Is the old couplet true—
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271' href='#Page_271'>271</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'There's a house 'tother side of the way,</p>
<p class="i1">And there they make Lucifer matches?'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Another customer entered, and Polly turned to her.
My parcel came. I paid for it and went out.
</p>

<p>
If Norman had not gone away would I have married
him?
</p>

<p>
I did not know anything about marriage in that innocent
childhood. Norman staying right along, and
we growing nearer each other, reading the same books,
enjoying thrilling or tender verses, walks and talks,
and then—I knew there would not have been any repulsion,
that I should have been glad, glad with supreme
joy, just as Sophie had been.
</p>

<p>
I laid the package down on the table. Father was in
his office, but I could not go in. I went up to our
room, took off my bonnet and glanced around. Dan
had been in and changed his clothes. Trousers thrown
over a chair, collar and stock on the bureau, shoes
and a soiled handkerchief on the floor. Dan had gone
off somewhere. The most curious repulsion came over
me. I could not touch one article to put them away.
Oh, if I could run away somewhere—but there was
father. Keeping together "as long as ye both do
live."
</p>

<p>
"Ruth!" called father.
</p>

<p>
It might have been minutes or hours, it seemed an
endless while to me.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get the paper? Come down. I want to
make out some bills. Dan's gone to Batavia for two
days, left his good-by. Why, Ruth, you look like a
ghost, what is the matter?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Do I?" I tried to laugh, but my mouth was stiff,
and I felt numb all over. "I don't think it anything.
I may have walked too fast. The sun is hot."
</p>

<p>
He put me in the big rocking chair. I picked up
a fan. I was cold enough, Heaven knew, but I wanted
to make some movement.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth, I think you are not well. You grow thinner
all the time, and you have no flesh to lose. We must
have the doctor. Child, I have been comforting myself
that matters were better with you——"
</p>

<p>
His kindly eyes were full of solicitude.
</p>

<p>
I made a great effort. "If you mean with Dan,"
I said, "they are. He is much pleasanter. I think he
has gotten over the trouble about the house, though
sometimes I have wondered whether he might not have
it when I am gone."
</p>

<p>
"No," father replied, almost with set teeth. "You
need not go for that. I'm not sure but it would be
better for you to deed it back to me. Still if things
go on, well——"
</p>

<p>
He hobbled to the closet and brought me some wine.
That refreshed me. Then he opened the package,
made out some bills, straightened his accounts when
it was supper-time.
</p>

<p>
John came over in the evening, and father would
keep him all night. I felt quite as well as usual.
When I went upstairs I laid the soiled things away,
hung up his trousers, but his vest fell to the floor, and
his knife and pencil rolled out with a bit of paper. I
put the two back, crumpled up the paper, then bethought
myself it might be a memorandum of something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
and spread it out, took it over to the candle. It
was a pencil scrawl.
</p>

<p>
"You will find me at Weesaukie's lodge at twilight."
It was not Dan's writing.
</p>

<p>
There was no name. He had taken Duke and gone
in the buggy. Was he to have a companion? It
turned me sick and cold again. Polly's glittering,
mocking eyes and her insolent tones with their half
veiled gayety swept over me. Was it—would it be
Polly? Oh, no, no, Dan could not do such a thing as
that!
</p>

<p>
For all Polly's brave show of mourning it was
whispered that her married life had not been altogether
serene, and that she made little ado about the loss of
her grandeur.
</p>

<p>
All night something haunted me, a kind of impersonal
agency, treacherous, trying to lure me somewhere
in darkness and vagueness, while I had to make
a great effort to hold back. And then I was wandering
over wild, dreary prairie land, at last coming out to
a strange black, silent lake. What splashed into it?
The cry woke me, and my heart beat with a great
terror.
</p>

<p>
"John," I said to the young cousin, "I want you to
go down to the Morrison house this noon and take a
note, but do not give it to any one except Polly. If
she isn't home, and she may not be, you say it is all
right, and be sure to bring the note back to me. Don't
leave your name or anything. Come back to-night."
</p>

<p>
It was a daring thing if Polly was home.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I busied myself about household duties, and in the
afternoon a neighbor came in with her two little ones.
What made every one so anxious to know how much
fortune Norman would have? Still I was glad of the
break, for father had gone out to look after the men.
The weather was fine and he was anxious to get in
some of the crops. Then he took a rest in his easy
chair.
</p>

<p>
I walked down the street a short distance. John
came hurrying along whistling, but stopped, thrust his
hand in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"She wasn't home, Cousin Ruth. The woman
wanted the note, but I wouldn't give it to her. She
told me to come on Friday."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I returned breathlessly. "Do not mention
it to father," and I took the missive.
</p>

<p>
Then Polly was away as well!
</p>

<p>
Dan came home late Friday night, good natured,
bustling, and announced that he must start early the
next morning for Galena on some important business.
He hoped I had not missed him much. He was sorry
to go away at this busy season, but he would make it
all right with father. Indeed, he began to think with
so much business of his own they would really need a
regular overseer.
</p>

<p>
"Now if that Gaynor boy was four or five years
older, he might come."
</p>

<p>
I was thunderstruck. "I thought you did not like
him," I half faltered.
</p>

<p>
"I don't, but your father seems to like him."
</p>

<p>
The tone was rather sarcastic. I made no reply. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
was glad he did not proffer me so much as a kiss. In
five minutes he was asleep.
</p>

<p>
So to Galena he went the next morning after a brief
colloquy with father.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to know what's got into Dan Hayne,"
father said, almost angrily. "I s'pose he's had a streak
of luck somewhere, he's gay as a lark, but he is sober
enough, and I'm pretty sure he hasn't been off on a
carouse. I suppose it is all right between you?" studying
me sharply.
</p>

<p>
"It was all pleasant, if that is what you mean."
</p>

<p>
He nodded, but did not look satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have to hunt up Jake Esden—and I suppose he
will be too busy to lend a hand. This kind of weather
can't last. If I wasn't such a battered old hulk!"
</p>

<p>
I clasped my arms around his neck, but I did not
sigh nor sob, though both rose in my heart. Whatever
came it would be we two.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have a week to ourselves anyhow," he said, in
a gratified tone.
</p>

<p>
A week in which to be glad that the husband of one's
life would be away. What a bitter travesty it was.
But this time Polly was home, making preparations to
go to Vincennes for quite a stay.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br />
DAN
</h2>

<p>
I was all alone that August afternoon. It was hot out
on the porch and I took my sewing inside. I liked to
sew when anything perplexed me. There seems a
quiet kind of diversion in the effort one has to make,
which is not much of an effort, after all. Father had
gone down to the warehouse to see about loading one
of the boats. One of the men was with him, though
he had learned to get about quite comfortably.
</p>

<p>
I heard a step on the walk. Dan's week was up and
he might be home any day. It had been a pleasant
and busy week, and it seemed as if most of the people
I had ever known had visited me. There was my old
friend, Mrs. Chadwick, who had come for her brother.
He was rather ailing now, and it was thought a change
would benefit him, so she would take him home with
her. She was still sweet and charming and intelligent
and we had a pleasant visit. Sophie came up with the
four children, and we enjoyed a merry, romping time.
Of course, she couldn't let Polly alone, but she admitted
the matter might have worn itself out, and now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>
she was preparing to take quite a journey. "Joy go
with her," declared Sophie.
</p>

<p>
Ben had returned, a fine, fresh-looking fellow, tall
and with a strong frame, rather thin now, but he was
full of ambition. He had been doing very well, and
oh, what joy it would be to see Norman, the most
splendid fellow in the world. Any day he might
arrive.
</p>

<p>
Chris, too, was full of delight. I had no time to
brood over my own infelicities.
</p>

<p>
No one had come yet to-day. It was too warm for
womenkind to go visiting even with the prospect of a
supper in which they had had no hand.
</p>

<p>
So when I heard the step I did not stir, neither did
I take the next stitch, but just listened for the voice.
Chris had a way of beginning his conversation on the
lowest step and talking all the way along. It must be
Ben, stopping to pet the cat. Then I turned, but could
not see who was in the hall, rose, and took a step
forward, and then we stood face to face with all
the years between. I was no longer a little girl, and
this was a fine, resolute man, clear eyed, the strong
features toned down by the tenderness and sympathy
the years had demanded of him, a face one could
trust to the death—Norman Hayne in his ripe manhood.
</p>

<p>
There came to me in that one instant a flash of
awful knowledge that I had no right to. I swayed
uncertainly. I put out my hand and all went dark
before my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Little Girl! Little Girl!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The longing sweetness of the voice pierced my very
soul, but I went plunging down some deep abyss. Was
I really dying?
</p>

<p>
When I came to, Jolette and father and a neighbor
stood there beside Norman.
</p>

<p>
"What was the matter?" I asked. "Why, I never
fainted in my life."
</p>

<p>
"Once is always the first time," said Mrs. Miller,
sententiously.
</p>

<p>
Father was pale with fright, and shook as if with
an ague, while his eyes transfixed mine.
</p>

<p>
"I came upon her too suddenly," Norman explained.
"I was so impatient, and I could not find any one."
</p>

<p>
"She has not been well of late," exclaimed father.
</p>

<p>
"And it has been a hot afternoon. Oh, how did you
stand it?" and I caught his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I was in a tolerably cool place. There is a breeze
coming up, and the sun has gone under a cloud."
</p>

<p>
"Yes. I think we might take her out on the porch,"
said Mrs. Miller. "Jolette, you carry the big rocking
chair."
</p>

<p>
"I am all right," and I gave a tremulous little laugh.
"Did I frighten you very much?"
</p>

<p>
"It was a pretty severe faint," Norman replied, still
looking anxiously at me.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Miller would lead me, though I could walk
very well, and only felt a little shaky.
</p>

<p>
The wind came up in a fluttering sort of gale, as if
it hardly knew whether to behave at its best or worst.
A drift of mauve and dun began to settle in level lines
along the west, making a bar across the sun. Other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
patches of white and pale gray chased each other about,
but there was no sign of shower.
</p>

<p>
"When did you get in?" asked father.
</p>

<p>
"About noon. I went straight to mother. Chris
was home. Oh, you can't think how glad I am to be
here. It has been a long exile from the many one
loves. And yet I ought not complain. I have been
needed every day of the time. But it seemed so strange
at the first glance to have every one grown up, although,
of course, I knew none of us stood still," and
he laughed with a cheerful, musical sound. It was
like a mellow echo of Dan's. And he was a refined
and noble copy of his elder brother, a gentleman in
tone, accent, the turn of the head, the glance of the
eye, the sort of atmosphere that surrounded him. I
thought I would like to have him more distinct in personality.
</p>

<p>
He remained to supper, but went immediately after.
He wrung father's hand until the pressure made him
wince, but he said a simple good-night to me, and I
was thankful. I could not have borne the clasp of his
hand.
</p>

<p>
There was great rejoicing, to be sure. We were
very neighborly in those days, and joy as well as sorrow
stirred all hearts. Then it was something to
have been nearly all over Europe, to understand several
foreign languages, to have seen kings and
queens.
</p>

<p>
A few days after Dan came home. He gave me a
careless greeting, and began to talk at once about
Norman.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I have not seen much of him," I said. "He and
father went driving yesterday, and he was surprised at
what he called the advancement of the prairies."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I suppose he carries his head very high. And
I dare say he came in for a big fortune. You won't
see much of him here, I can tell you. We're not half
grand enough."
</p>

<p>
"Your mother is a very happy woman. I went
down there yesterday, while the men were out. I had
been so busy with various matters. You must go and
see her."
</p>

<p>
He nodded, and busied himself with some papers he
was taking out of a drawer.
</p>

<p>
That was all our greeting after a week's absence. I
had a kind of stunned feeling, and did not really
care for endearments, though sometimes Dan was
very lavish of them. I had not yet grown used to
this revelation of myself. I must learn to love my
husband, it was my only safeguard. Otherwise I
should be a miserable, sinful woman. For I realized
now how I had loved Norman Hayne through these
years of my childhood, and how I could love him now,
how he would fill the spaces in my heart that had
never been satisfied. The pain and longing I had
never understood before.
</p>

<p>
There was another aspect to the case. Father's influence
had its share in the step I realized. He had
not thought then he could live very long, and it was his
dear love for me that longed to see me safe in some
one's hands. He suffered enough in knowing that my
husband had grown careless, he must never guess that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
I could have given my supreme affection to another
and been happy, blessed beyond measure.
</p>

<p>
Why had Dan married me?
</p>

<p>
He could not have been so much in love with an
unformed child, though I think I did amuse him with
my petulance and protests. He loved to conquer anything.
He could subdue the most fractious horse and
do more with an obstinate mule than any one else. He
really enjoyed my resistance. But was there any
thought that at father's death I should be left with
quite a fortune? There was his anger about the house,
his objections to young John Gaynor. Yet now they
seemed matters almost of indifference to him.
</p>

<p>
But there was my duty and my safety. Father was
a very upright man and used to clear distinctions, and
I knew I had inherited them. I was a wife and I had
no right to consider what my life might have been with
any other man, to brood over what I had missed.
</p>

<p>
It seemed truly as if Norman helped me. Had I
done or said anything in that moment of the lapsing of
consciousness? He came only when father was
around. Oh, what talks there were out on the porch,
to which I listened enchanted, yet I sat a little by myself,
or with father's arm around me. Mrs. Hayne
gathered the family together, and father went along.
Four sweet, merry grandchildren, Sophie bright, commonplace
to be sure, but a most excellent wife and
mother. We talked of the one who "was not," of the
night I had come a Little Girl, of the many delightful
old things.
</p>

<p>
Dan was there, but I noted a curious restlessness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
about him, as if he was bored, and an abstraction. His
thoughts certainly were elsewhere, yet he told droll
stories and anecdotes and chaffed Norman. When we
made ready to return Ben said he would go along, he
had an errand uptown. We were old enough to
divide our city in sections already.
</p>

<p>
"Ben—if you'll just see my folks safe home," he
said, "I'll be mightily obliged to you. I ought to see
some one on business, and I know I can catch him to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," assented Ben, and then Chris said he would
go, too. Norman was petting and playing with little
Ruth.
</p>

<p>
Dan walked a short distance with us and then turned
off with a cheerful good-night. But it was past midnight
when he returned.
</p>

<p>
It seemed so strange to walk on the edge of some
suspected but unknown danger, as if the ground was
mined somewhere along the way. I was outwardly
cheerful, I sang about the house, I tried to answer
blithely, I cooked the things Dan liked, I begged him
to come home early. I indulged in little caressing
ways, such as he used to fairly extort years before. I
put on whatever semblance of love I could use without
being effusive. It did not warm him at all, and he had
been so easily roused. What was this stone that I
surged against?
</p>

<p>
"Ruth," father said one morning, "what is Dan
about, has he told you of any new plans?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I answered in a kind of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"He is putting money in the copper mines up at Lake
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
Superior. He has sold that Lake Street property, at a
sacrifice, I think, and he asked me for a settlement.
He wants to go up to the copper fields himself."
</p>

<p>
"No, I have heard nothing about it."
</p>

<p>
Father came nearer and took both of my hands.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth, you cannot go up there, even with your husband,"
he exclaimed solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"He has not asked me. I do not think he would
want me." Yet I shuddered at the prospect.
</p>

<p>
"One cannot fathom him any more. Of course, he
was very plausible and all that, considering my interest,
and saying he had not time to attend to it, that he
might be away for months, and that now I was so
much improved a good overseer would answer my purpose.
But I say again he shall not take you. I would
as soon hand you over to a pack of ravening wolves!
Oh, my darling, I have no one in the world but you,
a broken, disabled, lonely old man."
</p>

<p>
He pressed me to his heart, and I felt the sob there.
The strong arms about me gave me inexpressible comfort.
</p>

<p>
"You need not fear," I returned. "He shall not even
drag me away."
</p>

<p>
"He will not try force. He may try fraud. I distrust
him. He used to be so frank and outspoken.
Will you be careful? Do not be trapped into anything,
for he is deep as the sea. It may be all this copper
business. I have seen men go mad about speculation
before, when they could dance a hornpipe standing
on their heads, their brains were so befuddled. It is
not drink, but some curious influence I cannot divine."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I shall stay with you always. It was one of the
conditions of my marriage. It was as solemn a promise
as anything else."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, my darling."
</p>

<p>
There certainly was what I should call an intense
change in Dan, not any superficial emotion. He sometimes
sat with his lips compressed, and his brow in a
frown, then it would suddenly lighten in such a wonderful
glow, an absolute radiance. What was he thinking
of?
</p>

<p>
Once, when I saw it, I went over and kissed him in
a kind of fascinated mood.
</p>

<p>
"Don't!" He pushed me away roughly.
</p>

<p>
A month before I would have cried, and felt stabbed
to the heart. Now I walked quietly away.
</p>

<p>
What weeks they were, not many of them, but the
days seemed shodden with lead, the sun hung high in
the heavens, as if loth to leave her throne.
</p>

<p>
I stayed mostly at home, helping father to go over
accounts. I remember the last week. Norman was
not in at all.
</p>

<p>
Was I longing for him? Was life drearier without
him? Well, if I was as weak as that then I must make
a new and greater effort. But it was fighting with
no line of defence behind me, no husband to stretch out
a hand.
</p>

<p>
Dan came in awhile before noon one day and began
to pack a valise. He had taken away some of his
belongings before. I had been mending a few articles
rather too bulky to be carried downstairs.
</p>

<p>
"I am going away," he announced, "up to Lake
Superior. The Prairie Bird starts this afternoon."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285' href='#Page_285'>285</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dan!" What should I say? "How long are
you likely to stay?" and I tried to make my voice solicitous.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer for a moment or two. Then
he turned around in a fierce fashion, and his eyes were
black as night.
</p>

<p>
"I may as well tell you," he began in a desperate
tone, "that I am not coming back at all."
</p>

<p>
I glanced up at him. I knew the color went out of
my face. I was so utterly amazed.
</p>

<p>
"You'll hear the story, but I may as well have the
gratification of telling you." His voice had a peculiar
depth, and his face was set with some tremendous emotion.
"I am going with the woman I love, and who
loves me with a passion you never could know if you
lived a hundred years! I should have married her in
the beginning, but I was a blind, idiotic fool, and she
had a temper. We were never sure of each other.
She made a pretence of caring for this or that one
when I ought to have wrung the secret out of her heart
and mastered her once for all. A woman like that
gives royally when she is compelled. You have to extort
it out of her, but the drop of honey is worth it all.
The old man who took her in hand never found the
way to the heart of the flower. That was saved for me.
And it is a delicious draught. We are going away together—we
shall never come back. What people say
is of no importance to us."
</p>

<p>
"It is Polly Morrison," I gasped. "Oh, Dan, if you
loved her, then why did you marry me?" I cried,
wounded to the heart's core.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Because I was a fool. She had gone out of my life,
and I said she could not have loved me as she professed.
And you were a silly little white kitten, never
quite sure whether you would jump on my knee or
not, so I made you. But what is there to you?
Some cold Puritan blood, some petty sort of tenderness
that has no fire in it—nothing to kindle a man
to the height of rapture. I tired of you even before
she came, and then my life was set aflame. She is
the one woman for me. A month, even, with her
would outweigh any other woman on the face of the
earth."
</p>

<p>
I sprang up. "Dan, your solemn promise!" At that
moment I hated to be thrust aside for Polly Morrison.
"You were not compelled to marry me. You—you did
love me then—a little."
</p>

<p>
He laughed scornfully. "You have just hit it—a
little. A man sometimes takes second best, more fool
he! You might have done if Polly with all her
witchery had not crossed my path. Or it might have
been some one else. There is no need of making a fuss
now. I have not wasted any of your patrimony. You
can hand it all over to John Gaynor if you like, and you
and your father can maunder on through life. And I
shall have a glowing, thrilling, absorbing atmosphere,
in which one really lives. No, don't come near
me—"
</p>

<p>
The bed had stood between us as I sat by the
window. Perhaps I had unconsciously stepped forward.
I had a wild idea that I must plead, that I must
exert all my wifely powers to keep him from committing
this dreadful sin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Don't come near me," he continued. "We will say
good-by with this space between us and no tomfoolery.
Perhaps I was idiotic to come and tell you this, but I
wanted you to know how the other woman was loved,
how a man loves when a woman fills every thought of
his soul. There—you and your father are well rid
of me!"
</p>

<p>
He picked up his valise and strode out of the room,
down the stairs. I dropped on the bed. I did not
faint or cry. I could hardly be any more deserted than
I had been the last two months. A deserted wife! A
husband by all of God's sacred ordinances who gloried
in his shameful love for another woman!
</p>

<p>
It stunned me. One moment it seemed incredible,
then his voice sounded clear and vibrant, as if he was
still in the room. Had we parted for all time? A
hundred little tendernesses rushed over me. The
laughing, teasing eyes that could hold so much meaning
looked into mine. Oh, he must have loved me once
and I had tried to love him, yes, sometimes I really
had, but it was a child's love.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't any one comin' to dinner, Mis' Hayne?" A
peremptory voice rang up the stairway.
</p>

<p>
I rose, bathed my face, although there were no tears
to wash away, and went down.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hayne gone away?" inquired Jolette.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I answered briefly.
</p>

<p>
"An' ye'r father out! I declar' to man ther' ain't
much sense roastin' ye'sself on a hot day an' no one to
come an' eat the wittles!"
</p>

<p>
I glanced over the table. The boiled dinner with one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
or two side dishes filled me with disgust, and yet I
thought how Dan would have enjoyed it. He was
hearty in everything. He had a big frame to take care
of and he did not stint it.
</p>

<p>
The wagon drove up and Sim helped father out.
So I waited until he was ready to come.
</p>

<p>
"The Prairie Bird starts out at two. Has Dan been
home?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and gone," I made answer briefly.
</p>

<p>
He glanced sharply at me. Jolette was too near for
any private comment.
</p>

<p>
"I saw him down by the elevator. Well, I hope he
isn't on a wild-goose chase that will bring down only
a few feathers. Wentworth thinks he's years too early,
but they may find gold up there as well as in California,
and copper may pan out in a valuable way. But
I think he was foolish putting so many eggs in one
basket. He's sold Duke to Baubein."
</p>

<p>
"He cared more for Chita."
</p>

<p>
"There's big money in Duke. He's a splendid
trotter."
</p>

<p>
I tried to eat. Father was hungry, and just as the
pie came on Ben entered and had some dessert, and
there followed a long talk with father, who then settled
himself in an easy chair for his nap.
</p>

<p>
Had Dan really told the truth? Was Polly to be
his companion? How would it come out? At all
events, I would keep my own counsel.
</p>

<p>
It had been a pretty warm day until about five, when
some suspicious clouds went scurrying across the sky,
and a blast of wind seemed to come off of an iceberg.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
We shut down the windows, the storm rushed up so
quickly. Then the wind fell. In a little while there
was such a peculiar light, not sunset, it obscured the
sun even, a strange yellow glow over everything, darkening
and yet not making dark. The air was now
very still. Men went hurrying homeward.
</p>

<p>
"There'll be a big storm," one and another said when
they came within hearing. I thought of the two out
on the lake and how Dan disliked the water.
</p>

<p>
There had been a curious talk about the end of the
world coming. Jolette was afraid, and up in her room
prayed mightily.
</p>

<p>
"It is strange," father said over and over again, and
he watched me closely.
</p>

<p>
After a while it grew paler and that gave everything
an unearthly glow. Yet it looked beautiful. It was
nothing like sunset, I had never seen such a light before.
The distant cornfields were simply magnificent.
Trees looked as if they were painted on a background,
every branch and twig were so distinctly outlined.
</p>

<p>
Then by slow degrees it faded, growing into evening
gradually. There had been no sunset, but night
was coming on quietly and the sky was a smooth gray.
</p>

<p>
Ben rushed in breathless.
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't it all been queer?" he exclaimed. "Mother
was sure the end of the world was here. They've been
preaching it a good deal to the eastward. Norme insisted
I should come up and stay all night with you."
How good the old name sounded! "He could manage
mother better. I never saw her so frightened. Were
you?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Well—the world is going to be destroyed by fire,
but it wasn't hot enough to melt the fervent elements,
so I thought we were safe," replied father jocosely.
</p>

<p>
Then they began about the prophecies, and how in
the first century they thought Christ would come the
second time before St. John died. Father had been
quite a great Bible reader of late years. We spoke of
Dan, too, and hoped he would reach his destination
safely. Evidently Ben nor mother had any idea he had
gone to stay, or that there was anything wrong. I
almost persuaded myself I had dreamed that cruel,
brutal talk. It had been interspersed with not a little
profanity. I hated swearing.
</p>

<p>
We went to bed at length. I felt so sore and sad
then, with all my life in ruins, that I cried softly on my
pillow. A deserted wife! And when the story came
out, how hard all the gossip would be to hear!
</p>

<p>
The Yankee clock in the hall rattled off its hours.
It always struck as if it might lose a second of time
between the strokes. Twelve! The eerie hour. What
if a ghost came to me! Oh, what was that!
</p>

<p>
An awful roar of something coming nearer and
nearer and then breaking into a thousand shrieks. I
sprang out of bed and screamed.
</p>

<p>
Father called to me, "Come in here, Ruth," and I
ran, frightened almost out of life.
</p>

<p>
I suppose there had been such tempests before. I
know there have been since. Ben came in wrapped in
a blanket and lighted some candles, then sat on the
foot of father's bed. It was something terrific. The
house rocked, we heard the trees crash down, the cries
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
of the animals and the frightened poultry, and that
mighty roar and swirl as if the destruction of the world
had begun. We were so near the lake that we guessed
what an ocean tempest must be with the great waves
pounding up, fighting each other like angry armies.
</p>

<p>
Then it began to rain. A great fierce deluge, this
way and that, whirling, beating, changing about,
thrashing, as if it meant to crush out life, the world,
everything. Oh, what torrents! It stamped on the
ground in its rage. It beat on the roof as if it meant to
crush it in, and was all the uglier for being foiled.
</p>

<p>
I snuggled up to father and pressed my cheek against
his. His arm was around me. We two, henceforth,
always. And what of the other two? I felt the boat
must have put in somewhere. It should have been a
magnificent night with the moon just past the full. I
thought of the ride on Chita in the harvest moonlight.
Other tender remembrances came back to me, and
from the depths of my soul I cried to God for their
safety, cried mightily, as if my own soul was at stake.
</p>

<p>
It was two before the storm began to abate at all,
then it rained steadily, and the wind raged, but not so
fiercely, the lake roared like a great booming cannon,
but the house had stood the shock and we were safe.
It had been so good to have Ben. Yet it was curious
we had none of us once spoken Dan's name, though I
think it was deep in our hearts.
</p>

<p>
The skies were still thick in the morning, as if layer
after layer had to roll away before it could clear. The
wind had mostly ceased, and the rain held up now and
then and came in gusts again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Oh, the destruction that greeted us! The lake had
been loosed it seemed and swept over everything.
Streets were rivers, some houses had been carried off
their foundations. We were on higher ground, but
there was only a short distance between us and this
great sea the wind had stirred up.
</p>

<p>
About ten the clouds began to lift a little and patches
of blue struggled here and there and were submerged
again. Poor Jolette had gone almost crazy and really
had not wit enough left to get breakfast. Ben and I
helped, but all the life had been wrenched out of me.
One of the outbuildings had gone over, but the barn
and stable and hennery were intact.
</p>

<p>
By noon Norman came over, waded over, for he was
mud up to his knees. The instant I looked into his
kindly, pitying eyes I felt he shared my secret. I did
not dare give him a second glance, for I knew I should
cry out in anguish.
</p>

<p>
After an hour or two the sun came out, as if quite
ashamed of the destruction the wretched myrmidons
of storm had wrought. And we heard how wharves
and storehouses had been submerged, vessels torn
away and wrecked, swept down to the end of the lake,
and such destruction as had never come upon us before,
as there had not been so much to destroy.
</p>

<p>
It was several days before the damage could really
be estimated. The waters subsided, the lake took her
mud and ooze and overflow. The sun shone as if it
was glad to help dry up and restore, and the blue skies
smiled, the winds seemed as if led by a child.
</p>

<p>
Some of the corn had been cut and stacked, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
rest, though beaten down, was so fully ripened there
would not be a great loss. Most of the grains had
been cut and housed.
</p>

<p>
"I declare, Gaynor, you do have the best luck of any
one I know," said a neighbor.
</p>

<p>
It seemed so. Father was really a rich man, but
most of it had come through thrift.
</p>

<p>
I felt weak and miserable. I was holding my breath
for some blow that would surely strike, and when I
looked in any one's face I felt as if I must scream.
</p>

<p>
Norman came up on the porch one afternoon. I
was walking slowly downstairs, and halted in the hall.
I did not hear what father asked, but Norman answered:
</p>

<p>
"Yes. They have heard. The Prairie Bird ran
ashore on some rocks that stove a hole in her, and then
was blown out to sea again. Only a few were saved,
two or three of the sailors. But that isn't the worst
news to face. It is going all over now. Poor Ruth!
If she might never know! For—how can I tell it?
My own brother, too!"
</p>

<p>
I stepped out. I suppose I must have looked like a
ghost. Norman stretched out his arms, but I tottered
to father.
</p>

<p>
"I know," I said, trying to steady my voice that
seemed blown about by the stress of emotion. "Dan
told me that day. They loved each other and went
away together."
</p>

<p>
"And were found dead, locked in each other's arms."
</p>

<p>
I fell over into father's chair. That was the last
I knew for a long while.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIX
<br />
HOW NORMAN CAME HOME
</h2>

<p>
Those years abroad had been very precious years to
me in spite of the great disappointment of not returning
home at the promised time. I found Mr. Le Moyne
a charming gentleman, and was not made in any degree
a servant, but treated like a relative. I knew
afterward that he took a great fancy to me from what
Mr. Harris said, and, as he told me, "he liked my face."
I kept accounts for him, wrote letters, read aloud,
studied and wrote to the Little Girl and my mother as
often as I could. She was such an innocent little girl,
and so sweet, so altogether different from the girls I
had come in contact with.
</p>

<p>
When we went to Washington, where Mr. Le Moyne
was entrusted with a very delicate mission that was
not to be put into writing, he decided to go abroad at
once, as his eyes were causing him great uneasiness.
We would not need to remain more than a year, he
thought. But months passed, he was improving so
much that the oculist thought he ought not break with
the treatment. It was one thing and another. He
came to depend so wholly upon me. And I never had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
the courage to tell him I had left a little girl in Chicago
that I desired sometime to make my wife.
</p>

<p>
I used to say things in letters that I hoped she
would take up, that might pique her curiosity, but they
did not rouse her. If I wrote to her, and she had no
especial love for me, that would end it. And how hard
it would be to have a long engagement. I was a little
afraid of my brother Ben, who had somehow stepped
into my place, yet it seemed mean to grudge him any
happiness if he could win her. Then Mr. Le Moyne's
health began to break and his eyesight fail, with some
new complication. He asked me never to leave him
while he lived. I could not deny him. So I trusted
my Little Girl to God. If she was for me it would all
come right in time. I was having a rich, full life and
developing in many directions. I did have a great deal
of the finest enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
But when I heard that Dan had married my darling
Ruth I was as one struck dumb with amazement. He
was a big, strong, burly fellow, full of life and jollity,
and not over-refined. But then I reflected Chicago
was not Paris, or London, or Rome, or Florence. It
was a hard blow to me. I had no duty left but to
devote myself to my benefactor. No father and son
could have lived in finer accord, or had tastes more in
unison. I was glad that I could comfort him in his
misfortune.
</p>

<p>
His health failed gradually, and the end came in
peace. He had dealt very generously by me. I found
it would take a long time to settle the estate, and resolved
to return home for part of a year at least.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
</p>

<p>
How everything had changed! Chicago had made
great strides, increased her business, widened her borders.
Fresh from beautiful cities that had taken hundreds
of years in their growth, this had hardly begun.
What was a place thirty or so years old compared to
their centuries of advancement!
</p>

<p>
Dickens had been over and touched up the West
with his caustic pen. Many people in Europe seemed
to think we as a nation were reverting to the Indian
type and lived in wigwams. I was astonished at times
at the little our neighbors really knew about us, compared
with our knowledge of the different European
countries.
</p>

<p>
After all my fascinating rambling about, and my
different attainments, this was home, and a man's
birthplace and his boyhood remembrances are always
dear to him. Two lines of a poem credited to Stoddard
always suggest this meeting to me:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"My mother fell on my neck and wept,</p>
<p class="i1">She kissed me and then she sighed,</p>
<p>And our hearts were filled with a silent grief</p>
<p class="i1">For * * * * the one who had died,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
and that was father.
</p>

<p>
Chris was home to supper. Homer and his wife
came in. Sophie had been a great friend of the Little
Girl's I remembered. Oh, how dear and sweet it was.
Mother kept studying me—she had in her mind the
boy who went away.
</p>

<p>
All the next morning the house was thronged with
callers. Mother was proud as a queen. Then I ran
away and went over to the Gaynors', hoping they had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
not heard. I had my wish. There seemed no one at
home. The doors stood hospitably open and I entered.
Then I caught sight of the girl who had never been
out of my mind all these years. I came upon her
unaware, and we stood face to face reading the inmost
secrets of each other's souls, knowing what might have
been, what we had lost. She put out her hand a little
blindly and then she fell into my arms. I caught her
and saved her from dropping on the floor.
</p>

<p>
I carried her to the settle and laid her down. She
was as beautiful as any statue I had ever seen. The
straight Greek nose with its thin nostrils, the rounded
chin with a faint dimple, the perfect brows, the tendrils
of hair that were like cloud-like vapor, so light and
showing the white skin through. I glanced a moment,
then I kissed her with the pent-up love of years, brow
and lids with their long brown lashes, mouth and chin,
but she lay like a form in marble, as if the tenderest
passion could not rouse her.
</p>

<p>
Then I called for help. A black woman came, and,
frightened, she ran for a neighbor. I tried chafing the
hands. I called her endearing names, and then I remembered
she was my brother's wife, but she was my
darling, nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Miller came, Jolette, the black woman,
skirmished up a bottle of liniment and one of camphor.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any brandy or whiskey?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," and she went for that. Just then John
Gaynor came in, and it seemed as if he would faint as
well. But between us all we presently had her restored.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I took her too suddenly," I began in apology.
</p>

<p>
"What did she say?" He eyed me sharply.
</p>

<p>
"She had not time for even a word of welcome," I
answered. "Is she well?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head with a reluctant dubiousness.
"I'm afraid she isn't quite," was the slow reply.
</p>

<p>
I noticed then that she was very thin. You could
see the blue veins in her arms and hands as well as her
temples.
</p>

<p>
She made light of it, though I understood she was
a little frightened, as she had never fainted before.
Then Mrs. Miller suggested we take her out on the
porch, where it was cooler, and we packed her in a
rocking chair. I fanned her slowly. Her father
placed his chair beside her. How he did love her. It
shone in every line of his face, which seemed to have
taken on a certain kind of refinement that had perhaps
come from the invalidism. I noticed that he used
great care in sitting down and getting up, and that he
was very lame.
</p>

<p>
I was fain to go away, not that I really wanted to,
but Mr. Gaynor insisted on my staying to supper. Dan
was absent, and he plied me so with questions that we
were summoned to supper before I had answered half
of them. Afterward we went out again. Ruth had the
chair tilted back almost like a couch. How slim and
graceful she was, most like to a willow wand. And
her sweet face told the story to me that she was trying
to make herself happy and content in a life that did not
fill her heart, and was slowly sapping her strength.
</p>

<p>
How we talked all the evening. She held her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>
father's hand—it showed little marks of toil now and
was shapely enough, but not as white as hers.
And when I went away John Gaynor wrung my hand
with subtle, meaning strength.
</p>

<p>
"You will come in often," he said. "We are so glad
to get you back."
</p>

<p>
How had these two people come to marry? I
learned some of the causes afterward. I was anxious
to see her and Dan together.
</p>

<p>
I had warm enough welcomes everywhere. The
interviewer had not come into existence, but I went to
the office of the <i>Prairie Farmer</i> and saw young John.
Then there was the <i>Journal</i>, a new friend in what was
then the Saloon Building. There was a daily <i>Tribune</i>,
rather shaky on its legs, in an old wooden shanty at
Lake and Clark streets. The Hon. John Wentworth,
of my father's old love, the <i>Democrat</i>, was on LaSalle
Street in quite grand quarters, the printing room
boasting a Hoe press from New York. And there was
a bookstore, laying a foundation of one of the great
publishing houses in years to come.
</p>

<p>
There was the old jail built, as the contract called
for, "of logs firmly bolted together," and the Court
House I had never seen before, on the northeast corner
of the square. It had offices on the lower floor,
but they were talking of a new one, as it was too small.
There was gas in some of the principal streets. But the
wharves and the grain elevator had improved most of
all, and the packing house was quite an institution.
Railroads were planned in almost every direction and
the canal was an established fact.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Dan returned a few days after. He was a big, handsome
animal, not gross, but with the material in every
line, the intellectual in scarcely none. He was shrewd,
jolly, forceful in all business matters, and had a laughing
face that won more by its good humor than his
argument. I had once thought he might be something
of a politician, but he was all business. Ben
would take up that line. Our Senators were Messrs.
Douglas and Shields, the Stephen A. Douglas I had
gone to hear speak long ago. They had won a grant
of land from Congress for a railroad from Chicago to
the Gulf of Mexico.
</p>

<p>
The gold fields had not taken as many of our men
as I fancied it would. The unfortunate revolutions in
Germany and Hungary had sent an influx of immigrants
over, many well-informed people among them,
ready and anxious to work for homes in the new
country, many of them farmers.
</p>

<p>
Mother was a very happy woman. I am not sure
but Chris came the nearest to her heart. He was her
last baby, and he had a religious tendency that harmonized
strongly with her now. She was proud to
have him preparing for the life of a clergyman.
Homer's children were her delight. They were merry,
pretty things and in exuberant health.
</p>

<p>
She felt somehow curiously about Dan, though his
marriage had not settled him quite as much as she had
hoped. Ruth was a lovely wife, but it was a pity there
were no children, when there was likely to be so much
money on both sides.
</p>

<p>
Because I loved her so and had been betrayed into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
that one impassioned moment I was very careful. I
went there when I was almost sure Mr. Gaynor would
be around. And Dan, I found, was seldom home of an
evening. Both Ruth and her father never tired of
hearing about my travels and Mr. Le Moyne.
</p>

<p>
Then a curious whisper seemed to pervade the air
about Dan, that he went a good deal to the Morrisons'.
He had been making some investments for Polly. I
ventured to call one day, but the house was shut up.
Polly went out very little among her old friends, it
seemed. It was reported that her rich marriage had
not left her a rich widow.
</p>

<p>
Dan was very much interested in the copper at Lake
Superior, and planning to make a journey thither.
But Sophie one day roused my indignation by telling
me that Dan spent nearly every evening at the Morrisons',
and that occasionally Polly stole out to a lane
below, little frequented, and met Dan and drove off
with him.
</p>

<p>
I knew after seeing Dan and Ruth together a few
times that whatever love he had once had for her no
longer existed. He was not rough to her, but cruelly
indifferent. Did she still care for him, or was this only
a semblance, this sweet devotion that would have won
any man's heart twice over? She clung so closely to
her father. There never could be a tenderer affection.
</p>

<p>
One evening I resolved to learn the truth of Sophie's
story. From the Gaynors' I went down to the Morrisons',
a long walk. The house was all in darkness except
a faint glimmer at the kitchen end. I crept softly
up, when a low growl from a bulldog fairly curdled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
my blood. I could not see where he was, and retraced
my steps cautiously. The next day I planned
differently. I stationed myself at an intersection of
streets, they were not much beside lanes, and sat down
under a tree to wait. There was no moon, and at first
a rather hazy sky, but it cleared presently into magnificent
starlight.
</p>

<p>
From my point I could see down to the house. It
was all a blur at first, but by degrees I became so accustomed
to it that I could discern the outlines of all
between. A tree partly hid the side, but the front was
dimly visible.
</p>

<p>
It was ten when I took up my vigil. Eleven, half-past.
Perhaps I was on a fool's errand. Then—yes,
there were two figures stepping out in the open space.
They found parting such "sweet sorrow" that it
seemed as if they would say "Good-night 'til it were
morrow." Their arms were about each other, their
faces turned from me, but close together. A long,
long embrace, then Dan started away swiftly.
</p>

<p>
I rose. He took the other way, but I stepped over
there.
</p>

<p>
"Dan," I exclaimed, steady voiced, "Dan!"
</p>

<p>
"Who the devil are you?" sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Norman Hayne, and I want to talk with you. I
know where you spend nearly every evening."
</p>

<p>
Dan whipped out his pistol and uttered an oath.
"You've been spying on me, and it's the last time
you'll spy on anybody, you mean sneak."
</p>

<p>
I put up my hand. We were facing each other, and
we were both of a height. My heart was unprotected.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"See here, Dan," I said calmly, "you could shoot me
and my dead body might be found in the morning.
That is not all. Before noon Chicago would know the
name of the murderer and his connection with the
woman down there. If you are willing to yield up
your life and draw down obloquy on the woman you
have just left, then shoot."
</p>

<p>
Dan still held the pistol.
</p>

<p>
"That devil of a Gaynor put you on the track, curse
him," in a vengeful tone.
</p>

<p>
"No, I do not think he suspects such a thing. He
imagines you at the hotel talking business and playing
cards, and he is proud that you come home sober. It
is from this neighborhood the report has spread. You
have taken her out driving. Your true wife that you
must have cared for when you married owns your
fealty. I do not need to read you a lecture, you know
what you are doing and the end will be a scandal that
will not raise you in any one's estimation and break her
heart. It will also drag down the other woman."
</p>

<p>
"A miserable puling, white-livered thing who has no
heart to break, who cares nothing for love, could not
understand it!" he flung out.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you marry her? Why not have taken
Polly at first?" I questioned sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Because I was a blind, dumb fool all the way
through. And when she married I thought that the
end of it."
</p>

<p>
"And when you married, that was the honorable end
of it."
</p>

<p>
"No, it wasn't the end at all. Love with fire in it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
may smoulder, but it breaks out into a flame if one stirs
among the ashes."
</p>

<p>
Dan suddenly put away his pistol.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Norme, I'll admit the whole thing is
wrong. But a love like that sweeps a man off his feet.
I'm going away presently and shall be absent two or
three months, and maybe I'll get over it. You see, Polly
had some troublesome business to settle. She wasn't
left at all well off by that miserable old weasel of a
Frenchman. I made some investments for her, and
somehow her story was a sad one and she had been
my old love, and now that I am going away—Ruth is
good enough, but she isn't my kind. Maybe up there
all alone I'll straighten matters out and come to my
senses, and when I return things may go better with
us. Polly and her mother are going to Vincennes to
live. She doesn't feel at home in this old mud hole any
more. So that's the whole of it. I'm all-fired sorry,
Norman, that I went at you so, but the thought of
being spied upon made me thundering mad."
</p>

<p>
The whole thing rang false. Yet I could not controvert
it. He <i>was</i> going away. About Polly I could not
tell. Perhaps she had planned to follow him.
</p>

<p>
"Dan," I said—"on your word and honor?"
</p>

<p>
"As God hears me," he answered solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"You would break your mother's heart as well, and
disgrace us all. And the way Ruth looks, it doesn't
seem to me you will have to wait long for your
freedom. She is almost transparent."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, those thin people are wiry. She's always
looked so. She'll live to be eighty."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"She was a rosy little girl."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you just trust me, I've given my word."
</p>

<p>
Here was where I had to turn off to mother's, and
we said good-night.
</p>

<p>
Dan was not home the next evening, but if he went
to the Morrisons' he took another way and entered by
the garden. And there was a bright light in the parlor
that fronted the street.
</p>

<p>
I could only wait. I knew people bent on an intrigue
could outwit the keenest eyes.
</p>

<p>
Dan came over to say good-by to mother, and was
so tender it brought tears to her eyes as she told it
over. He was most cordial to Sophie and the children.
I went down to see him off and he shook hands in a
friendly manner. It was a splendid day. I thought
I would go to the Morrisons' that evening to see if all
was right, but there came up a curious threatening
blow. I spent the evening with mother. She was very
proud of Dan and was delighted to think he had given
up drinking to any excess. Liquor drinking was a
very common thing even among respectable people,
but drunkenness was beginning to be frowned upon.
</p>

<p>
About midnight the storm broke. We did not feel
it so much here, but the roar of the elements was something
frightful. I am sure I had never known such a
storm. The wreck and damage were terrible. Mother
was almost crazy about Dan.
</p>

<p>
I made my way to the Gaynors' about mid-afternoon.
Their house was solidly built of brick and they had
suffered very slight damage. Ruth was a pale little
ghost and her sapphire-blue eyes asked wordless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
questions. None of us spoke of the Prairie Bird. It
was too soon to hear.
</p>

<p>
The lake seemed strewn with wrecks. At the warehouses
everybody was appalled. The only hope was
that any boat seeing the storm coming up would run to
shelter.
</p>

<p>
Four days afterward a sailor, escaped from the
wreck, came into Chicago and told the story. Of the
bodies that were beaten up ashore there were two
locked in each other's arms—Dan Hayne and Polly
Maseurier—and they were buried together. The best
cabin had been engaged for her and she had come
aboard in the morning. They had partaken of a gay
supper together, and now it seemed half the men suspected
she would flit with him. He had been selling
out his Galena interest and most of his property.
Chita had been taken with them, and she, too, had
found a watery grave.
</p>

<p>
I must go to the Gaynors before some one rudely
bruited the tragedy to them. John Gaynor could break
the news more tenderly to his child. I was glad to
find him on the porch in the old reclining chair, reading
his paper.
</p>

<p>
I don't remember how I told it. I think I left something
to be inferred. I did not hear Mr. Gaynor's
question, for a white wraith glided out on the porch.
The soft light hair framed in the sweet, deathlike face,
but the clear eyes shone out with an unearthly light. I
would have caught her, but she went straight to her
father.
</p>

<p>
"I know," she said, and her voice was like a low-toned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
bell shaken wildly about. "Dan told me that
day. They loved each other and went away together."
</p>

<p>
Then she fell into her father's lap.
</p>

<p>
I lifted her to the settle, limp and lifeless. It seemed
as if she had lost all her flesh during these days that
she had carried her secret. Was her heart broken?
My poor Little Girl! My poor Little Girl!
</p>

<p>
I went for the doctor presently. All night she lapsed
from one faint to another, and was left as near lifeless
as any human body could be. Mr. Gaynor watched
her dry eyed, but with such an expression of despair
as is seldom concentrated in any countenance. He
would place his cold hand in mine, that was so vigorous
and warm, that I felt almost ashamed. I had given
her up to Dan, I could not give her up to death.
</p>

<p>
After two days fever set in. It was not raging or
violent, but the lassitude was painful to witness. The
boys were both going away, and I persuaded mother to
shut her house and come up. Her sorrow was heart-breaking,
but she knew it was still worse for Ruth.
</p>

<p>
The result of the storm was being cleared away and
repaired. There was a good deal of talk, to be sure,
and the men who had liked Dan best blamed Polly
bitterly. Others did not see how he could have thrown
up his prospects for any woman, for it was admitted
if all went well with Mr. Gaynor and Chicago Ruth
would be no mean heiress.
</p>

<p>
Sad as it was to watch day and night with only a
mere thread of hope, it took mother and Ruth out of
the head of the gossip. I looked after Mr. Gaynor's
affairs as well as I could, and there were some matters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
of Dan's left unsettled. He must have taken a considerable
amount of money with him, but whether it was
in the bottom of the lake or buried with him no one
was ever to know.
</p>

<p>
After a month or so Ruth began to evince a slow
improvement. "If she had enough strength to pull
through," the doctor said with a faint inflection in his
voice that sounded like hope to the waiting, longing
ear. She could not have had a tenderer nurse than
mother, and womanly care and sympathy exceeds that
of the most loving man.
</p>

<p>
Through this time I learned by bits and snatches
how this ill-fated marriage had come about. And
although at first Mr. Gaynor could have rejoiced over
Dan's untimely end, he had built high hopes on him
and would have loved him like a son. Even now he
referred to the kindly things Dan had done for him in
his illness, and I could see Dan had held many fascinations
for him. But when he wanted to get all the
property interests into his hands and began to treat
Ruth with indifference all the fatherly feelings were
roused. Then he had grudged young John Gaynor
the relationship.
</p>

<p>
I could not but admire the wise and kindly reticence
he observed in speaking of Dan. Of course there was
no glossing over the last cruel insult to Ruth, but poor
Dan had paid for it with his life, Polly as well.
</p>

<p>
I had many plans in my mind through this time.
Go back to Paris I must. The boys had gone to their
different institutions, and that left mother alone.
Homer wanted her to rent the house and live with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
them. Then in watching Mr. Gaynor it seemed to me
that something might still be done for him. Surgery in
Paris had made rapid strides. There were splendidly
equipped hospitals, perhaps I might find them in
New York or Philadelphia, but I could not go there to
stay. If I might take them all to Paris with me,
mother as companion and chaperone for Ruth.
</p>

<p>
I advanced my plans very cautiously. Ruth's welfare
was my first point. She did not get along rapidly.
The doctor had insisted on having her beautiful hair
cut, and it was now a mass of rings, like silken floss.
She seemed to have gone back to childhood, her face
was so small and wore such a look of timid entreaty.
Her eyes were still like the midnight blue of the sky
and their expression penetrated one's very soul with
their infinite pathos.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gaynor at first considered a journey abroad for
himself an impossibility with his farming interest. It
did puzzle me a little to know how this could be managed.
And when I was about discouraged in my
search for a capable person Providence sent him right
in my way. Since the unfortunate struggle in Hungary
we had received many immigrants of the better
class who had largely drifted to the West in search for
land. Homer had taken a young man to work for him
when he had spent his little all. He and his father had
been successful wheat growers, but their farms had
been confiscated. The young man had left his wife
and two little ones and the mother with friends, hoping
soon to be able to send for them, but they found it
very hard to get at anything without money.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I asked them to come over and spend an evening
with us. John Gaynor was much interested in them,
for both were intelligent, though speaking rather
broken English. They discussed the possibility of
buying government land and tilling it, and exploited
their own methods, which were not behind ours, but
their markets were.
</p>

<p>
The upshot of this was at the proper time my plan
of having them as overseers, living in the house and
looking after everything.
</p>

<p>
"It would be a godsend to them," said Mr. Gaynor.
"They could get quite forehanded. These are the kind
of citizens we need."
</p>

<p>
I left the leaven to work without any needless
stirring up. Then I sought to persuade my mother
that it was her duty to go for Ruth's sake. Since one
of ours had so nearly wrecked her life surely we ought
to strive to repair it.
</p>

<p>
"An old country woman like me," she cried in a
kind of indignation. "A woman who has baked and
brewed, and washed and ironed, milked and churned,
and spun and spent the best of her life waiting on menfolk!
A pretty sight I would be to go to Paris!"
</p>

<p>
"We should not expect to live at court," I laughed.
"I was quite an ignorant lad when I went there. And
if it was best for both Ruth and her father? She could
not go without you."
</p>

<p>
It did take a good deal of argument and persuasion
as well as good temper, but at last I gained my point.
We had the father, Michael Sontieff, come and stay
with us and found him clear minded and a really able
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
man. They could send for the family at once. The
mother and the young wife had some money of their
own and were most anxious to rejoin their husbands.
</p>

<p>
So the matter was settled to my great delight.
Ruth was willing to do anything. I did not like the
apathy, though it was so sweet one could not chide her.
</p>

<p>
Mother was still an energetic woman. And now that
there was some real work devolving upon her, she was
happy and cheerful. Her best belongings were sent
to Sophie's and her house rented. She packed away
the choicest of the Gaynors', she looked up the articles
and clothing we needed for our journey.
</p>

<p>
"I feel as if I was going on a fool's errand," said
John Gaynor emphatically, "but if Ruth can recover
her health and forget the sad tragedy I shall be
repaid."
</p>

<p>
The Sontieffs came in delighted. Young John was
most loth to have us go. He had the making of a
newspaper man in him, he would never have been a
successful practical farmer.
</p>

<p>
We went to New York, and the middle of April we
sailed for Liverpool. It was a pleasant voyage and
the ocean trip did seem to revive the drooping Little
Girl.

<h2>
CHAPTER XX
<br />
THE PASSING OF OLD CHICAGO
</h2>

<p>
That two years abroad was like a happy dream, the
romance of our lives. Everything was queer to my
travellers at first. Ruth made amusing attempts at
French, of which she did know a little. Mother would
have none of the "gibberish."
</p>

<p>
When we were quite domesticated I consulted
several surgeons, who examined Mr. Gaynor. The
limb, they thought, had not been rightly set. They
would not say it could be altogether remedied, but that
it could be greatly improved, though the process would
be tedious, and perhaps take three months.
</p>

<p>
That time was not discouraging. We had come to
the merciful period of anæsthesia, so the conscious
suffering was reduced. He decided to undertake it.
The prospect of going without a crutch was most
tempting.
</p>

<p>
During that period mother, Ruth and I took various
delightful journeys about the environs of Paris. It
was in the early days of the third Napoleon and Paris
was very brilliant. Many improvements had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
made, and my two guests were filled with amazement.
There was so much beauty on every hand.
</p>

<p>
After the first fortnight we were allowed to see Mr.
Gaynor. The surgeon admitted that it had been a
rather serious case, and the operation would be the
means of prolonging his life, which could not have
gone on much longer without a fatal issue. I thanked
Heaven that I had been so importunate. After ten
weeks the patient came home. He was not to give up
his crutch immediately, but he could bear some weight
on his foot, which would have to be provided with a
cork soled shoe, as his leg had shortened somewhat.
</p>

<p>
I was quite engrossed with Mr. Le Moyne's business
until along in the winter. Then we went to Spain, and
saw Madrid, Granada and other famous cities; the
great fortress at Gibraltar, and crossed the beautiful
sea to the Bay of Naples, sojourned a brief while in
Florence and Rome, went up into Switzerland, Germany,
Holland, then down to Paris again, where I
received my fortune. And here Ruth and I were married
at the embassy, with many friends to wish us Godspeed.
Mr. Gaynor was a very happy man. He
limped a little and used a cane, but could get about so
easily that he declared he had renewed his youth.
Mother was delighted and admitted that she had
always coveted Ruth.
</p>

<p>
Ah! what happy days those were. We went to England
and her two tributaries. Mother declared that I
kissed the Blarney stone. She had become quite a
foreigner.
</p>

<p>
How would we ever endure Chicago again?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But one evening, as Ruth's head lay on my shoulder,
and her sweet mouth just where I could heap kisses
upon it, she said:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Norman, I would like to go home. And I
know father is longing for it. Everything is beautiful,
but I want to ramble about the old places. I want to
think of the days when I was a little girl and see the
spot where I first came to you."
</p>

<p>
Had she always been mine? It seemed so now.
The other life was like a dream.
</p>

<p>
Two years had passed away. I am afraid we were
a little disenchanted at first. But here were all the old
friends—very few of them had dropped out of life.
Brave Jesse Walker, the pioneer Methodist preacher,
was among the first to welcome mother. And there
was Mr. Porter, whose wife had been our earliest
school teacher, two or three of the ex-mayors, Mr.
Hubbard and the Doles of my boyhood and many
another.
</p>

<p>
The town had not stood still. But the most wonderful
thing to me was the invincible push and perseverance
and industry, the resolve to establish a great city
on those foundation stones, not ancestry, not mere intellectuality.
All roads should lead to it as they had
to old Rome. Some were started, others planned and
there were great dreams. It seemed queer after the
finished aspect of the Old World.
</p>

<p>
The Sontieffs had done very well indeed. Both
wives had come, a somewhat severe-looking middle-aged
mother, who was sweet and tender at heart, a
rather pretty, light-haired young wife of some German
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
stock a generation or two back, and two very foreign-looking
children, such as we had seen in groups in the
old cities.
</p>

<p>
The men had been informing themselves in American
ways and methods. They would go farther back
and buy government land. Already quite a colony had
been formed and two men had been sent out prospecting.
It was to be not far from the great canal, but
now railroads were being planned. California had
given an impetus to us. The Pacific was to be our
western boundary. We would not even stop at the
Rocky Mountains, and have not those brilliant dreams
been fulfilled? Has Chicago proved herself a mere
braggart?
</p>

<p>
Young John Gaynor was a man grown, and as we
found soon afterward, had a sweetheart, a fine sturdy,
honest-looking young fellow with the breezy voice one
insensibly acquires when the spaces are wide.
</p>

<p>
Homer suggested father very strongly to me. He
was building, buying and selling, preferring the nimble
sixpence to the slow shilling. They had a new little
girl, and they called her Bessy. Sophie was stout and
energetic, a lovely mother. Nanette had a little family
also, and it seemed as if the population had increased
rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Ben had one year more in the law school. He was
coming back to Chicago.
</p>

<p>
"I want a place to draw a good long breath," he
said. "Out here there is room for new States and cities,
and a man can forge up to the head sooner. It makes
me laugh to hear those Eastern people talk. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316' href='#Page_316'>316</a></span>
think they have it all. Some day they will wake up
mightily surprised."
</p>

<p>
Chris was doing well and growing really handsome
in a more spiritual fashion than any of the other of us
boys. He was mother's darling, after all.
</p>

<p>
It was about autumn before we were truly settled.
Mother was to remain with us. The house was enlarged
a little and renovated, and partly new furnished.
Mother had her furniture in her two rooms, she fancied
she might like to keep house by herself, but she
never did.
</p>

<p>
Certainly there was not a happier man in Chicago
than John Gaynor, unless it was myself. He trotted
about inspecting the new elevators, the new vessels,
gathering statistics, as if he were a newspaper reporter.
He had not given up what he called his scribbling
habit, and his delight was to draw comparisons with
the peasantry of the Old World and the New World
that had no peasantry.
</p>

<p>
That Christmas morning a new little girl came to
Chicago. The other little girl was only a memory
now, just as Old Chicago was fast becoming a
memory. But you often heard a group of men exchanging
old reminiscences of the time they first
came in the early thirties, with a small amount of
money on hand, some none at all, going to work with
hearty good will.
</p>

<p>
John Gaynor had thought nothing could make him
happier than the return to his native land, but I think
his cup ran over that Christmas morning.
</p>

<p>
There came now and then an unfortunate year, perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>317</a></span>
that is not the term, a less fortunate year, but
Chicago travelled on at her steady pace. West of us
were growing up other great States, other cities,
crowds of people coming to be fed and housed and
finding room to grow broad not only in physique, but
in mind and endeavor. So we travelled over in the
sixties, when there were ominous clouds gathering and
there was a larger question to struggle for than bread
and shelter.
</p>

<p>
John Gaynor went on adding field to field. I
laughed at him for a mania. "Ground is a good
enough investment for me," he would say. "Thieves
can't steal it and fire can't burn it up." But Homer
and I were joining forces in building stores and warehouses.
For now we were connected with most of the
country with railroads. How could we have brought
in the grain in ox-carts?
</p>

<p>
Then followed the four years of the terrible Civil
War. Ben, just getting nicely established, threw up
his business and went in the army with hundreds of
promising young men. The city did its share nobly.
Some came back and took their olden places, some
were invalided, and many a home was left vacant.
</p>

<p>
John Gaynor returned and made another stalwart
plunge in newspaper life. Ben opened a new office and
went on to realize his dreams. For now Chicago again
swept on with giant strides. Did any one raise pigs
and chickens in the space about the house, or even
garden truck? We raised our town step by step. There
were miles of paved streets, and all the modern improvements.
The log houses vanished. Stone and
marble came in and great buildings were reared.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We were swept onward too, business overtook the
old home like a great wave, and we went further
up the lake front and modernized ourselves. Since our
Paris sojourn mother had taken kindly to improvements.
Homer's sons and daughters were growing
up. Ruth was married, John Gaynor and his sweetheart
had a family clustering about them. Ben was
thriving, had captured one or two excellent positions.
Chris had gone westward, a very earnest pioneer
worker, and we looked sometime to see him made a
bishop.
</p>

<p>
Those were happy years. We had a little flock of
four, and though grandfather was proud of the sturdy
boys, baby Ruth, the first born, was, I think, the dearest
of all to him. The last darling was Bess. They would
always be family names.
</p>

<p>
We had had one other tremendous flood to submerge
a part of the city. Then great pains had been
taken to protect us from the overflow of the lake.
We studied security more than money. When we
looked at the splendid buildings did we ever say
to ourselves: "This is the great Babylon we have
builded!"
</p>

<p>
There had been a long, dry hot spell. Late corn had
withered and scorched up before ripening. Winter
wheat was parched. Our pretty flower garden was
watered assiduously, and the lawn, but the blossoms
drooped, the grass turned brown. What sweltering
days they were those September days, with the glowing,
pitiless sun that set in a bed of flames that scorched
up the kindly dews. It did not seem as if there was any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
moisture left in the lake. What would we have done
without our splendid water-works!
</p>

<p>
Then October came in. We had talked of a journey
up in Michigan for a little relief, but fortunately we
had not gone.
</p>

<p>
There came up a strong southwest breeze and we
took courage, although there was not a cloud in the
sky. "But it must rain presently," we all said.
</p>

<p>
Sitting there on the porch, which was quite a high
one, we saw the spires of flame shooting up skyward.
It was so far away that we only looked and commented.
Whether it was the unfortunate kick of Mrs.
O'Leary's cow that sent the lighted lamp over in the
hay, as is the commonly received version, or some
other fatal incident, the fire broke out in a crowded
portion of the city, where old rookeries abounded,
always a menace. One almost felt it would safeguard
the city to have them burn down, and burn they did.
Whether any more vigorous work or alarm could have
prevented the spread no one could decide afterward.
</p>

<p>
But by midnight the conflagration was overwhelming.
Fire and wind swept in wild fury. It came
northward in two grand, separate columns, tossing its
firebrands to the right and the left, and then it made
a mighty sweep over the river. Was there ever anything
like it for sublimity and terror? The brute
creation was crazed. Horses ran wildly about, roared
and kicked, the air was filled with cries and screams
of maddened people. On and on it flew, whirling great
masses of flame from one point to another. Grand
hotels, warehouses, stored full of valuables, the Chamber
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
of Commerce, the banks, the great shopping palace
of Fields, Leiter &amp; Co.—it was no respecter of persons.
</p>

<p>
We had sent the two smaller children to bed tired
out, but we could not go, fascinated with terror. I knew
a great part of my investments were swallowed up—that
Homer would lose much of the work of his life.
This way and that it dashed. Stone and marble
crumbled and went down. There had been the burning
Rome and Alexander's orgie at Persepolis—were
they to be compared to this?
</p>

<p>
We had thought ourselves safe, but the demon flew
on and on. Nothing could withstand him. We began
to pick up our valuables and load whatever wagons we
had and send them out toward Lincoln Park. The
streets were full of crying, shrieking, homeless people.
And when it came nearer, nearer, we, too, joined the
throng, but we were all safe together and made our
way out where the air was not quite so dense with
smoke, and at length dropped on the brown, shrivelled
grass, and clasped our arms about each other.
</p>

<p>
It has been written over many times, the loss and
ruin, the indomitable energy of the people, the suffering
and the courage, the heartiness with which every
one set about mending his broken fortunes and helping
his neighbors. Safes and money had perished.
But the grand spontaneous outburst of sympathy, the
proffers of help from other cities was cheering in the
extreme. With one voice they said, and we said,
Chicago must be rebuilt in a better and more enduring
shape. It is true that many solid structures had gone
with the flimsy ones.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321' href='#Page_321'>321</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was no more Old Chicago. And the Little
Girl had come to middle life, but her eyes had the old
light, her lips were soft and sweet as she kissed me
that morning in the midst of our desolation.
</p>

<p>
"We have each other," she said, "and our children
and father and mother."
</p>

<p>
Are some people "born for luck?" as the saying is.
If so, surely John Gaynor was. He had sold his summer
crops and a good part of his corn, and the day
the money was paid him turned it over on a new purchase
of prairie land he had made. If it had been in
the bank it would have gone to feed the flames.
</p>

<p>
"I told you land wouldn't burn up," he said. "We
have the sure promise until the last great conflagration."
</p>

<p>
But my row of stores and buildings were gone. I
was a poor man and must begin the struggle with
business again, if one could find anything to do in such
devastation. Homer had fared better. Mother and
Ruth and the children accepted their hospitality for the
winter.
</p>

<p>
John Gaynor was near seventy, but brisk and hearty
and helpful, hopeful, too, I ought to say. He would
have enough to start the four children in life. Why
should I worry about them?
</p>

<p>
How Chicago arose from its ashes, stronger, more
magnificent, more durable, and still kept stretching out
its thews and sinews in every direction is a matter long
since gone into history. Banks, hotels, public buildings
and stores could be restored in a more durable
manner, streets widened and improved, parks and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
squares added, but many things could not be replaced.
The grand collection of the Historical Society, and the
great Emancipation Proclamation, next to the Declaration
of Independence, the Chicago Library, with books
and archives, and engravings of old houses and old
streets, even then forgotten by many, with other valuable
articles that could not be duplicated. Truly, Old
Chicago had been swept away.
</p>

<p>
Did we sit down and weep over the vast ruin such as
had never befallen any city? There were starving
women and children to have food and shelter, and
those who had shared joyfully with these. All that
was best and noblest and broadest in humanity came
out then. The kindliness, the pluck and the courage
was something wonderful amid all that destitution and
desolation.
</p>

<p>
Like a romance Chicago rose from her ruins and
ashes to be grander than any one had dreamed, and
her men again worked their way up to prosperity with
indomitable energy. Homer lost less than I, but it was
enough to make us poor men. John Gaynor started
in afresh with his paper with cheery Yankee spirit.
Ben's stock was largely ambitions, and he lived to
realize upon them.
</p>

<p>
I prospered to some extent afterward and we had a
happy time. We went out of our own city by railroad
to San Francisco. We went up to Oregon, south to
famous cities. We were the centre of the country, we
were the granary of the West, the East. We helped to
feed the starving nations of Europe, that less than
sixty years before had believed us an uncouth, half-Indian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
people and doubted if any good could come out
of Nazareth. It was done by persevering industry, by
largeness of aim, by sterling integrity, by the great love
of every citizen for his native city, and the desire to see
her stand in the front rank.
</p>

<p>
We built our new house near the lake front again.
Little Ruth married when she was barely seventeen,
and John Gaynor lived to hold his great-grandson in
his arms. A cheerful, happy man, going down the
great decline peaceful and content, followed not long
after by mother, who was sometimes afraid she had
had too many of the good things in this life, but she
had always been pitiful to the Lazarus at the gate and
not left him to be nursed by dogs.
</p>

<p>
When Chicago reared the magnificent White City,
the like of which no one had yet attempted, we were in
the older generation with our grandchildren about us.
They never tire of hearing how grandmamma travelled
from Massachusetts in a big country wagon, with all
the household goods they could carry, crossing New
York and Ohio, stopping by the way to catch fish or
shoot game and cooking by the wayside in a stone
fireplace, sleeping in the wagon, sometimes roused by
wild animals, occasionally meeting Indians, and at last
reaching Chicago and grandpapa. It is better than the
best of their gilded and engraved fairy books.
</p>

<p>
What days we spent in the White City inspecting
the treasures of our own and other countries! What
a wonder electricity and the telephone was, and a hundred
other things. And the great city stretching out
along the lake, southward, westward, northward, its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
railroads running swiftly to and fro, its streets a busy
hive of the industry that has made her famous.
</p>

<p>
The trolleys go everywhere and at times we ramble
in them or out of them. Here is old Fort Dearborn
with the tablet to mark its memory. Did we loiter
about it and sit on the steps and recapitulate the
massacre? And here was the old Kinzie house, where
the San Domingo trader had his cabin, and here the
first school I went to, here the old Towner log cabin
where the Little Girl lived, and I used to come in and
help her get supper, and we read that dear, delightful,
stirring "Lady of the Lake." Here we went to Sunday
School and walked home together. But dearest of
all is the old house where we five boys were born and
brought up, because here I first saw the Little Girl as
her father lifted her out of the wagon and I glanced
into her sapphire blue eyes and loved her forever after.
</p>

<p>
None of them are there. We look at them through
the wizard glass of memory. There is no more Little
Girl, there is no more Old Chicago.
</p>

<p>
Then we kiss each other and go our way. We have
lived and loved.

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
